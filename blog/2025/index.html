    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Richard Darst visited UCL RSE to see what we can learn from them, and
learned the following from speaking to Jonathan Cooper, the Director
of Collaborations at ARC.  Thanks to Jonathan for checking and
improving this post.</p>
<p>The RSE team at UCL (“collaborations and consultancy”) is part of Advanced Research Computing Centre
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/">ARC</a>), which is a
department-level organization within the university.  Like Science-IT
at Aalto, it is not part of their IT Services, but also not part an
academic department/faculty: it’s sort of their own thing.  Overall,
they have around 120 people, of which about 60 are in the
“Collaborations Team”, which is basically the RSE side of things
(broader, as they have more professions, but the equivalent in type of
activity as the RSE side of Science-IT).  They are professional (not
academic career track) staff, but ARC does have some academic
affiliation which allows them to take part in academic teaching when
it’s needed.</p>
<p>The actual RSE work is part of “<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/collaborations-and-consultancy">Collaborations and Consultancy</a>”
and consists of jobs titles such as Data Scientists, Data Stewards,
Research Software Engineers, Digital Research Managers, and Research
Infrastructure Developers.  It is not that different from Aalto RSE
work, but their scale means they have more emphasis on large projects.
Many of their staff are assigned to various projects for months at a
time (usually more than one project, but not too many - actual
day-to-day time allocation is decided based on what works for each
project).  Many projects have a more senior and junior staff member
working together, or at least aware of the work.</p>
<p>Other sides of ARC are platforms &amp; services (HPC and many more
research-focused IT services) and teaching/training.  Overall, ARC and
ARC Collaborations are quite similar to Science-IT and Aalto RSE, but
at a much larger and more industrial scale, capable of helping very
many more people.</p>
<p>ARC’s RSE team has grown over the years.  It started in 2012 with 3
posts, and by around 2016-2017 it was 8 people and began growing very
rapidly.</p>
<p>I was especially interested in the work of RSE within research groups
(this was the original purpose of the meeting).  There are several
main strategies they use.</p>
<p>A project provides funding and ARC staff member(s) are deployed to
work on the project, scheduling as it makes sense. This is the most
common approach, for large and small projects. All ARC staff area
are on permanent contracts because when any given project funding
ends, they know there will be other projects available.  This is
what we have done with some flagship projects.</p>
<p>“Professional opportunities” - this is a special middle ground.
Someone is hired as a RSE to a research group, with ARC’s help in
recruitment.  They are paid and work within the group (with a job
title such as postdoc). ARC supports their work and makes sure it
goes well.  After the funding is over, the person is pre-approved to
join ARC permanently if they wish (assuming things have gone well,
which thanks to ARC’s help, they always do).</p>
<p>“Associate ARC membership” - people outside of ARC can become
associated and be part of chat channels, meetings, internal
trainings, etc.  This allows others to improve their research
engineering skills even without being employed by ARC.</p>
<p>Like we have found, they think that full time permanent employment is
best for professional RSE work.  Short-term contracts like postdocs
results in mixed motivations and constant turnover.  They have scale
so that they know people are always being hired, so that they can
essentially promise postdocs positions when they are done.  This
allows higher quality candidates and for them to focus on their RSE
work, not think about what (academic) job might come next.  They
currently (in 2025) have enough history to have approval to hire 6 new
staff each year (even without knowing exactly what projects they will
work on).</p>
<p>Just like at Aalto, one can also ask “should these staff better be
hired within research projects in academic departments?”  And just
like at Aalto, the answer is “yes, it could make sense - but these
departments aren’t current set up to teach, mentor, supervise,
promote, and keep RSE skills.”  Thus it’s a separate team, just like
at Aalto.</p>
<p>Overall, my evaluation is that if ARC is doing a lot of things right,
Aalto Science-IT is doing it right too.  There are implementation
differences as you might expect from the different national and
university environment.  My thoughts for the future are:</p>
<p>ARC RSE began growing very rapidly after about 5 years of existence
(6-8 staff/year).  Aalto RSE is that point now.</p>
<p>Hiring RSEs to research groups is possible, but is different than
hiring to a central team.  It requires close cooperation and thought
about their future career paths, otherwise the effect is only a bit
different from a postdoc.</p>
<p>Research computing is different than university IT Services, I like
the way UCL research computing is a different department, but
practically speaking I don’t think we can or should go towards that
now.</p>
