    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2023/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">kickstart course</span></a> came and
went with very few problems.  This post summarizes our general
thoughts on the course and its format.</p>
<p>If you want to join the course next year (as an attendee, or as an
organization who will send your learners to us (and maybe co-teach)
<a class="reference external" href="https://fosstodon.org/&#64;SciCompAalto">follow us on Mastodon</a>.  This
is the third year we’ve done the livestream format, and it’s not
likely to stop anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>This was originally written in June 2023 but publication was
forgotten until 2024.</em></p>
<p>The course has run since around 2015 or so.  Until mid 2020, it was always
in-person only.  Until (and including) 2022, it ran twice a year,
January and June, but now it runs only in June (increased availability
of videos + the material compensates).  It runs in June so that it
aligns with new summer research interns starting.  Until around 2020,
it was mostly about using the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">HPC cluster at Aalto
University</span></a>, but since then there has been more
emphasis on day 1 covering generic skills needed for scientific
computing and the big picture of things.</p>
<p>Our general feedback remains quite positive.  Our streaming +
coteaching + collaborative notes format is still well received, and
there seems to be little reason to go back for courses of smaller
scale.  Instead of just lectures, written material (tutorials in info
on scicomp.aalto.fi) + livestream + videos is a good combination.</p>
<p>There is never enough time - not much else to say.  Each year there is
a different trade-off between how much we cover and how brief we are.
(There are always people who say we should go more in-depth, and some
who say we go too much in-depth.  Such is life.)</p>
<p>Repetition is good, but not when it’s a sign that we can’t stop
talking and keep saying the same thing over and over.  The best
lessons seemed to be the ones that were taught most quickly, since it
has a high density of new information.  We should strive to make more
lessons faster, and leave details to the reading.</p>
<p>Because the teachers also do support, for anything difficult, we can
easily tell learners: “Do what you can, come by our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/#garage" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-ref">SciComp garage</span></a> to ask for help with anything
else.  This overall reduces the demands from teaching: a person
doesn’t have to know everything, but know enough to get started and to
know when they may need more help for more advanced tools.  This
really is good for both of us.</p>
<p>As usual, we expected our learners to read our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/">shell crash course</a> in advance.  We also had
a new tutorial on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/cluster-shell/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">using the cluster from the shell</span></a>.  This helped some, but it was still a
problem.</p>
<p>Reflection: this will always be a problem in any course that has a
wide enough audience.  We should accept and provide positive support
for those not ready, and not try to exclude them.  It’s OK to see a
course and then strive to get the prerequisites later.</p>
<p>Internally, we had this thought of dividing the course in two: a basic
part at the start of the summer, and an advanced part at the end of
the summer -
since brand new researchers may have trouble understanding
everything.  On the other hand, the fact we have videos means that
people can come back and review the material when they are ready.  So
in some sense, learners can divide the course however they would like
by stopping when they think it’s no longer necessary and coming back.
This could be mentioned more explicitly in our introductions.</p>
<p>Attendance goes down day-by-day.  This is definitely OK - it doesn’t
hurt anyone.  It’s expected that day 1 was suitable for the most
people (even those not doing HPC work), and then the course topics got
continually more specific as we went further and further.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this is even be expected and encouraged - better
to have someone attend day 1, than not.</p>
<p>Our exercises are quite basic overall, but we got few complains about
this.  Basic exercises are better than something too advanced or
realistic, that requires many things to come together.</p>
<p>This year, we tried to have a complete solution for every exercise
(script and/or commands), even if it’s directly said above in the
lesson.  This seemed to be good, since for people very short of time,
they still have some chance to copy and paste and do the exercises.
For those passively following, they can at least see what would have
been done.</p>
<p>Day 3 / end of course feedback positive feedback (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code> is the way a
person votes for/agrees with that option:</p>
<p>it’s great that the material is so easily accessible also after the
course to go through things in my own pace again oo</p>
<p>Really good format with the streaming and the shared document for
questions. ooooo</p>
<p>The cat kept me focused in the lecture</p>
<p>Live interaction with the instructes were very helpful and exercises were nice</p>
<p>I really appreaciate the instructors took the time to explain the
jargons, instead of just letting them fly around. o</p>
<p>The fact that the instructors were really nice contributed to the
good course experience. Thanks for that! o</p>
<p>(day 1) After studying remotely for 1,5 year and having lots of
online classes, I highly appreciate the amazing audio quality
here. Many thanks for that!</p>
<p>(day 1) The framework is better than any other workshop I’ve ever
attended - in terms of interaction and audio quality. HackMD is
great.</p>
<p>(day 1) The (twitch) vertical screen thing is genius and should be
used in way more (online) lectures o</p>
<p>Most common negative feedback: not enough time! In fact, that’s
almost only thing to improve. Except we can’t, so I think we win
pretty well. And videos/material allows follow-up.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>It’s time for our “kickstart course” - let’s talk about what that is,
why, and why you might want to attend.</p>
<p>The full name is “Introduction to scientific computing and HPC”
(high-performance computing), and it used to be called “HPC Kickstart”
and was taught without the first day, thus the short name “kickstart”
we still use.  Some years day 1 had a different name, but was still
taught together with days 2-3 as a package.</p>
<p>Our goal isn’t just to teach some skills, but to form a community
around scientific computing - with researchers who have a common
language to work together and help each other, supported by Aalto
Scientific Computing in the background.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2023/">Course page in 2023</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong> is not about high-performance computing things, but the
basic skills needed to do scientific computing: things like Linux
usage, data management, the types of tools available for different
problems.  For almost anyone doing any kind of programming/scientific
computing kind of work, regardless of background.  These kind of
skills aren’t taught in academic degree programs.  We teach these on
day 1 because otherwise, new researchers have to learn from each other
or re-invent.</p>
<p><strong>Days 2 and 3 are about high-performance computing, more precisely
basic cluster usage</strong> (with a focus of the basics).  This is focused
on the kinds of tools our community usually uses.</p>
<p>The topics are refined after many years of both teaching and support
of junior researchers.  Because of the way academic careers work (much
diversity of paths), these topics (even day 1) aren’t just for new
researchers but everyone can find something to learn or brush up on.</p>
<p>For the past years, we have been trying to keep up this yearly summer
schedule.  This usually happens the first full workweek:</p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> HR introductions, other formalities for new summer
workers - many departments seem to something like this.  This may
happen early than Monday of the kickstart week, since sometimes that
comes too late.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday afternoon:</strong> Kickstart course day 1, the general scientific
computing introduction.  Applicable to everyone doing scientific
computing.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday-Thursday afternoons:</strong> The HPC cluster usage part, which fewer
people will attend compared to Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> we don’t have scheduled programs on Fridays, but
sometimes there are communities who host advanced tutorials here
about what their local users need.  In 2023, there is at least an
advanced GPU course then.</p>
<p>We are aware that there is a scheduling conflict with the CS summer day
which is scheduled on the Tuesday of the 2023 HPC kickstart course.
We did contact every department in January/February, yet this was
still a surprise to us.  In past years, we have adjusted our schedule
to similar events, but this is not possible this year despite our best
efforts.</p>
<p>We will still try to support researchers as much as possible.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/&#64;aaltoscientificcomputing3454">Recordings of previous years are available on youtube</a>, and we
also release videos the same evening as the course precisely to
support everyone regardless of these conflicts.
Researchers can still join us for day 2 and 3 even if you did not join
day 1. However, please pay particular care to the instructions about
setting up the Triton connection in advance.</p>
<p>We hope that this blog post can explain our goals to a larger audience
so that we can reach even more people in the future, so that we can
expand to onboarding even more young researchers even more
systematically.  You can reach us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:scip&#37;&#52;&#48;aalto&#46;fi">scip<span>&#64;</span>aalto<span>&#46;</span>fi</a>, and
each spring we reach out to the main departments to schedule each
summer’s course.</p>
