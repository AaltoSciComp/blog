    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Richard Darst visited UCL RSE to see what we can learn from them, and
learned the following from speaking to Jonathan Cooper, the Director
of Collaborations at ARC.  Thanks to Jonathan for checking and
improving this post.</p>
<p>The RSE team at UCL (“collaborations and consultancy”) is part of Advanced Research Computing Centre
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/">ARC</a>), which is a
department-level organization within the university.  Like Science-IT
at Aalto, it is not part of their IT Services, but also not part an
academic department/faculty: it’s sort of their own thing.  Overall,
they have around 120 people, of which about 60 are in the
“Collaborations Team”, which is basically the RSE side of things
(broader, as they have more professions, but the equivalent in type of
activity as the RSE side of Science-IT).  They are professional (not
academic career track) staff, but ARC does have some academic
affiliation which allows them to take part in academic teaching when
it’s needed.</p>
<p>The actual RSE work is part of “<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/collaborations-and-consultancy">Collaborations and Consultancy</a>”
and consists of jobs titles such as Data Scientists, Data Stewards,
Research Software Engineers, Digital Research Managers, and Research
Infrastructure Developers.  It is not that different from Aalto RSE
work, but their scale means they have more emphasis on large projects.
Many of their staff are assigned to various projects for months at a
time (usually more than one project, but not too many - actual
day-to-day time allocation is decided based on what works for each
project).  Many projects have a more senior and junior staff member
working together, or at least aware of the work.</p>
<p>Other sides of ARC are platforms &amp; services (HPC and many more
research-focused IT services) and teaching/training.  Overall, ARC and
ARC Collaborations are quite similar to Science-IT and Aalto RSE, but
at a much larger and more industrial scale, capable of helping very
many more people.</p>
<p>ARC’s RSE team has grown over the years.  It started in 2012 with 3
posts, and by around 2016-2017 it was 8 people and began growing very
rapidly.</p>
<p>I was especially interested in the work of RSE within research groups
(this was the original purpose of the meeting).  There are several
main strategies they use.</p>
<p>A project provides funding and ARC staff member(s) are deployed to
work on the project, scheduling as it makes sense. This is the most
common approach, for large and small projects. All ARC staff area
are on permanent contracts because when any given project funding
ends, they know there will be other projects available.  This is
what we have done with some flagship projects.</p>
<p>“Professional opportunities” - this is a special middle ground.
Someone is hired as a RSE to a research group, with ARC’s help in
recruitment.  They are paid and work within the group (with a job
title such as postdoc). ARC supports their work and makes sure it
goes well.  After the funding is over, the person is pre-approved to
join ARC permanently if they wish (assuming things have gone well,
which thanks to ARC’s help, they always do).</p>
<p>“Associate ARC membership” - people outside of ARC can become
associated and be part of chat channels, meetings, internal
trainings, etc.  This allows others to improve their research
engineering skills even without being employed by ARC.</p>
<p>Like we have found, they think that full time permanent employment is
best for professional RSE work.  Short-term contracts like postdocs
results in mixed motivations and constant turnover.  They have scale
so that they know people are always being hired, so that they can
essentially promise postdocs positions when they are done.  This
allows higher quality candidates and for them to focus on their RSE
work, not think about what (academic) job might come next.  They
currently (in 2025) have enough history to have approval to hire 6 new
staff each year (even without knowing exactly what projects they will
work on).</p>
<p>Just like at Aalto, one can also ask “should these staff better be
hired within research projects in academic departments?”  And just
like at Aalto, the answer is “yes, it could make sense - but these
departments aren’t current set up to teach, mentor, supervise,
promote, and keep RSE skills.”  Thus it’s a separate team, just like
at Aalto.</p>
<p>Overall, my evaluation is that if ARC is doing a lot of things right,
Aalto Science-IT is doing it right too.  There are implementation
differences as you might expect from the different national and
university environment.  My thoughts for the future are:</p>
<p>ARC RSE began growing very rapidly after about 5 years of existence
(6-8 staff/year).  Aalto RSE is that point now.</p>
<p>Hiring RSEs to research groups is possible, but is different than
hiring to a central team.  It requires close cooperation and thought
about their future career paths, otherwise the effect is only a bit
different from a postdoc.</p>
<p>Research computing is different than university IT Services, I like
the way UCL research computing is a different department, but
practically speaking I don’t think we can or should go towards that
now.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>What is a Research Software Engineer (RSE)?  Too many things to
define, you can find these definitions elsewhere.  Maybe the question
you would like to know is <strong>How do I get value from Research Engineers
like Aalto Scientific Computing does?</strong> - that’s what we’ll try to
answer here.  Through that, we may learn a functional definition.</p>
<p>This page is written from the perspective of <em>computational science</em> -
similar messages may apply to other fields.  Note that computing and
AI is in every field now.</p>
<p>When someone wants Research Engineers, it’s probably because they see
something that is missing in the current academic system.  Thus, to
understand what we want, we need to understand the system.  Below is
rkdarst’s current mental model:</p>
<p><strong>Academics</strong> are who we usually consider researchers.  They do
research, and are promoted based on articles published and citations
received from other academics.  Citations from academics tend to
focus on innovation and novelness, so that’s what decides career
paths.</p>
<p><strong>Research Engineers (REs)</strong> focus on the practice and “structural
integrity” of the research: the tools, the reproducibility, and
more.  They are more concerned with the work being done well, than
pure novelness and citations. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>0<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are a subset of Research
Engineers, and I feel that the “software” is the least significant
part there.  Software is important, but so is data, computing,
reproducibility, etc.</p>
<p>Particular examples of things that Research Engineers are good at
include: Reproduciblity, maintaining software and data across academic
generations, Open Science, programming, using large computer
clusters, data security, and research ethics processes.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers</strong>, in my mind, cover both of the above (and more).
Industrial research teams would have both of the above and possibly
even more different roles all working together on their problems.
In universities, we tend to only consider the academics to
researchers.</p>
<p>So what’s a Research Engineer?  To me, it’s defined mostly in terms of
what is missing from the typical academic career path (of
undergraduate → junior researcher → senior researcher).  At all
levels, I’ve seen research engineering under-valued and under-taught
(not necessarily because it’s not wanted, but because it’s not novel
science and there’s no time).  Senior researchers (group leaders)
often see the value, but don’t have the time (or sometimes ability) to
train and supervise research engineers well.</p>
<p>Years before Aalto RSE started (~2017-2018), I saw a need for more
basic skills (for example: version control to manage code) and worked
to promote them in undergraduate programs.  This basically didn’t
work, because they were seen as not scientific thus not something to
be taught in academic courses (and if they were thought, the courses
would be full of people looking for easy ECTS).  While there certainly
are study programs in software and software engineering, these are
their own thing, and not part of data science, or other fields that
need computation.  Software engineering programs also aren’t adapted
for the unpredictibility of research.</p>
<p>This was the prompting to start Aalto Research Software Engineers - if
we can’t teach people skills in study programs, we have to support
them when they become researchers (and teach it via practical
mentoring).  This has worked out very well, as you can see by our
rapid expansion and heavy usage.</p>
<p>Aalto RSE is essentially the collaborator our research groups need to
do their top-level work.  This system works very well, but are there
other options?</p>
<p>The above leads to various ideas.  Take your pick for what angle
you want to approach the problem:</p>
<p>Better RE teaching in undergraduate programs:</p>
<p>As part of existing programs (is there time to teach this?  Is
there desire?  On the other hand, RE skills are great for
employment prospects)</p>
<p>As dedicated majors? (Some people are trying to make dedicated RSE
study programs at different universities, and there is a value
there.  But if you ask me the best value is learning RE along with
academic research in a different field)</p>
<p>Better RE teaching in graduate programs:</p>
<p>Many of the same things as above apply here, mainly the lack of
time, and the necessity to spend time on novel research, not
learning existing best practices.</p>
<p>Nurture REs within existing research groups:</p>
<p>Nothing stops group leaders from hiring students and postdocs who
have chosen to focus on research engineering.  This often happens
when supervisors hire technical postdocs to manage the RE side of
things.  (The question is: can they be supervised and mentored
well by academic supervisors, if they need to be home-grown?)</p>
<p>If group leaders hire good candidates, Aalto RSE can help mentor
them.  See the companion blog post <a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">RSE work rotations</span></a>
for one idea.</p>
<p>Recruit REs as professor-level group leaders” similar to how senior
academics are recruited:</p>
<p>These people would focus on collaborating with others to make
projects possible.</p>
<p>The university systems don’t seem set up to value these people,
thus they don’t appear among the ranks.  They could appear if they
spent their careers chasing academic citations, but then would
they be able to spend enough time on research engineering?</p>
<p>I think this is what some people mean when they say they want a
RSE career path: a way to recruit senior academics who lead
research engineering groups.  I think the idea is good but it’s
not how universities are set up, so it’s a long way off.  The
values systems may not even match up.</p>
<p>Create parallel structures that support research engineering</p>
<p>That is what Aalto RSE has done.  We are researchers, but we make
new research possible by collaborating with academics, instead of
trying to publish by ourselves.  We are part of the services of
the School of Science.</p>
<p>We also take it upon ourselves to do teaching and mentoring via
co-working for all types of researchers (aspiring academic or
research engineer).  We can fill in the technical mentoring that’s
missing by many supervisors.</p>
<p>You can read about <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/history/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">our history</span></a> in
more detail.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many people interested in gaining research engineering
competence for their organization.  You need to develop an environment
where they fill in the gaps you need.</p>
<p>Junior academics: encourage them to explore their technical skills.
Show that there is value in this, even if it reduces the number of
publications.  Encourage them to get training (for example the Aalto
RSE training).  Give them time, encouragement, and career prospects
to reach beyond the focus on papers.</p>
<p>Other support staff at universities and other organizations: don’t
view them as limited-purpose supporters of an {infrastructure,
service, process}.  View them as supporters of research: let them
holistically support research projects from many angles at once,
rather than only in narrow silos with strict project reporting
requirements.</p>
<p>You can hire dedicated staff to be REs, but it’s important that they
are integrated into the local research environment.  Most of our
hires have been local staff who have grown into a new role, and I
think this is how it should be.</p>
<p>Any of the above, especially the first two, require time being made
available for RE work and a clear vision and network.  Aalto RSE (with
the help of others in Finland) is planning on making a networking and
onboarding program for new research engineers who wish to adopt this
vision.</p>
<p>If you read this far, you probably see the value in research engineers
and want them yourself.  Just hiring someone, or changing someone’s
job to “RSE”, won’t magically solve the problem you need.  It’s a
whole mindset shift towards a multi-disciplinary research team.</p>
<p>What’s the right level of research engineers, permanent and
experienced or junior and learning?  Probably a bit of both.</p>
<p>I know that “Research Engineer” is a job title that can have
other definitions.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Let’s say you want to start a Research (Software) Engineer team in
your own unit.  How do you set your new hires off on the right
path?  A proposal is outlined below.</p>
<p>This is a companion post to <a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-collaboration/"><span class="doc">Future RSE collaboration in Finland</span></a>.</p>
<p>You need to find the right person to hire for the role.  Most likely,
this means someone with the skills you need but the mindset to
transition from their own work to making other work possible.  You can
find hiring resources on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">the Aalto RSE page</span></a> and some brief thoughts in the companion post
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-collaboration/"><span class="doc">Future RSE collaboration in Finland</span></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have hired someone.  What’s next?</p>
<p>This proposal is much easier for someone inside of Aalto University
than outside, but possibly could be negotiated for others.</p>
<p>Your new hire works as part of the existing School of Science RSE
team initially, perhaps ~1 year.</p>
<p>The hire is paid, organizationally supervised in, and sits in your
own unit.  It is absolutely critical that they maintain close
connections to your own unit, the membership in our team is only
virtual.  (Our team is remote-first, so this is easy).</p>
<p>They focus on projects from your own unit, but as part of our daily
flow.  This could mean asking your audience to join our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a> for help and requesting that new big
projects come via our project management systems.</p>
<p>Your new hire will learn all about how we work.</p>
<p>Your new hire will experience a tremendous diversity of projects and
work with experts on them.</p>
<p>After the initial ~1 year period, we sit down and decide what is
next.  Does your new hire stay working as part of our team (with a
greater focus on your own unit’s projects)?  Or do they split off
and start doing their own thing in your unit?  Or some combination?</p>
<p>This gives you the most important part of our onboarding and training.
There is no better way to develop the right mindset.  If we split
later, your staff will know who to ask for harder problems that come
up later.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>The Aalto University School of Science has a successful
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Research Software Engineering service</span></a>
serving the whole university.  This service has proven its value and
there are an increasing number of questions of how others can form
their own teams in Finland and work together.  This post gives some
thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>This page is the opinion of the author and not Aalto itself.  It’s not
an open offer for collaboration.  The author is happy to help with any
questions you may have (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">first.last&#64;aalto.fi</span></code> or various chat
systems).</p>
<p>Universities have academics: the traditional core, making ideas and
new results.  Much research, even not “computer science”, needs
computational tools.  However, the skills needed even for basic
computation can be so complex that not all academics can master it to
do cutting-edge research.  A Research (Software) Engineer (RSE) can
bridge that gap: academics focus on their primary work, and the RSE
makes the computing seamless.</p>
<p>For more info, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Aalto RSE site</span></a>.
This is not that different from research engineers supporting complex
physical equipment.</p>
<p>We’ve found there are plenty of qualified people to hire.  The harder
part is mentoring them to transition from a researcher (focused on
single projects with emphasis on own publications) to supporter
(supporting a wide variety of people with respect and compassion).
This transition needs active mentoring.</p>
<p>See the companion post about
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">work rotations for RSE mentoring</span></a> -
if you are in Aalto University then start there.</p>
<p>You should decide if you want (a) wide-ranging support which may
include helping with basics or (b) specialist support for a
limited audience.  I would argue that our most important impact is
(a): this has gotten us the most benefit overall, and a steady stream
of more advanced projects as work advances.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want your own RSE team at your own organization.  How
can you and Aalto RSE work together?</p>
<p>Even without joint funding, some of us Aalto people would be happy to
talk and give some advice, and be part of a broader general network.
For example:</p>
<p>How our team works, what makes it work, advice for your team</p>
<p>Joint RSE seminars to build skills, for example as part of
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/tech/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>FCCI Tech (aka the SciComp Tech series)</span></a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://nordic-rse.org/events/seminar-series/">Nordic-RSE seminar series</a>, or something new.
Both of these are good for professional development and community.</p>
<p>All the advice and practices on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">the Aalto RSE site</span></a>.</p>
<p>Professional networking and so on.</p>
<p>However, without funding, Aalto needs to focus on its own work.</p>
<p>With joint funding, it might be possible to make a collaboration.</p>
<p>Any higher level collaboration needs to be discussed with management.
Assuming these discussions go well, we might join a collaboration
together so that we can actually share projects between the team.
There should always be a strong local presence, because
that gets the best value.  This opens more possibilities.</p>
<p>The more experienced or larger teams could provide:</p>
<p>Mentoring possibilities for new research engineers and their teams
(see <a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">RSE work rotations</span></a>).</p>
<p>A base for professional networking.</p>
<p>A larger base of knowledge, for more advice and help with specialist
problems.  A very important part of our team is that for almost any
problem, someone has seen it and can solve it quickly.  Then we
train others to solve it.</p>
<p>Joint support sessions such as our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a>,
which allowed a wider support base for problems, covering the
previous point.</p>
<p>The newer or smaller teams could provide:</p>
<p>Funding via some joint project.</p>
<p>More staff around to help fill in the gaps when needed (these staff
also get training in these projects they experience).</p>
<p>Specialty domain knowledge (both for support of academics and for
professional development).</p>
<p>A collaboration with larger funding could have a joint project flow:
there is one place to submit new projects requests, and the right
people in any organization will work on them.</p>
<p>We would welcome observers in our support sessions, especially from
other staff at Aalto.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://nordic-rse.org/about/getinvolved/">Nordic-RSE chat</a> is also a good way to
ask questions and see what we are up to for those outside Aalto
University.</p>
<p>We know of various opportunities being considered for national
(Finland) or international RSE collaborations.  The above are some
basic thoughts, but any model would be tailored to the actual funding
and partners.  There is definitely a benefit to starting off
together.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>The “Research Software Engineer” service provides technical
collaborators for researchers to complement their scientific
knowledge.  <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Read about Aalto RSE here</span></a>.
The idea of this service was that it would be available to everyone,
but some projects who made extensive use would fund it themselves.</p>
<p>If you are a group leader reading this, Aalto RSE can help you release
research code, debug it, make it reusable, rescue old code from former
members and make it usable again, make it run on our cluster or CSC’s
clusters, manage data, prepare data for easy use, and so on.  If it’s
not long (less than a month), our work is free, if it’s more than a
month, the below applies.</p>
<p>When we started, we hoped for around 50% project funding.  The idea
was that a lot of the funding for the service would come from the
research projects themselves.  This hasn’t really worked out so well,
because a) we accomplish the vast majority of our projects quickly, in
less than a few weeks, and b) finance would understandably not like to
deal with small transactions for small amounts of time.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that we basically have received only a small amount of the
project funding we would have wanted.  On the other hand, this also
means we have supported a far wider variety of projects than we would
have otherwise.  It also means we are better accomplishing our other
goal: tactical support right where and when it’s needed most, with the
least amount of administrative overhead.  This actually better matches
our mission of helping the researchers who need us most.</p>
<p>For any <strong>long projects</strong> (more than a month or so), we still follow
do our original plan: we can receive funding from grants (or basic
funding) to do long-term projects.  This is usually 40-80% of a RSE’s
time, spread out over more than a month (and it can also be bursty:
lots of work at some times, waiting for the next task at other times).
We have done this for projects, and we know we can do it in the
future.</p>
<p>But there’s another thing that has worked well: <strong>retainer</strong>-type
funding instead of project-based funding.  You have extra funding that
needs to be used?  You know your group needs support but you can’t
name a single specific project to use all the time?  Hire RSEs on
long-term retainers and we’re there for you as needed.  <strong>You will
always get priority for all the quick questions you have</strong> (in
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a> or otherwise), and you get the highest
priority for your medium projects, we can attend your other group
meetings, and so on.  As your team wants, we’ll make high-impact
improvements here and there.  This could be (for example) anywhere
from 10-40% time over a long period.</p>
<p>We <em>have</em> worked out how to do both one-off projects and retainers
with Finance.  As for as external funders are concerned, our staff
count as researchers, so we can use any funding you might have.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you have a project or want us on retainer, let us
know:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Research Software Engineers</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/how-we-work/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Starting a project with us</span></a>.</p>
<p>This is a valid questions.  Compared to many RSE groups, we seem to be
focusing on many small questions for a broad audience that knows a lot
about the problems they need to solve.  Thus, we can come in to
something already set up well, provide help, and mostly back off and
be available for maintenance long-term.  The units that fund us
(schools, departments) have been happy with this, so we’ve kept it up.
On the other hand, we are pretty fast.  There have been projects where
a summer worker was going to be hired, that we could end up doing
(learning the framework + all the main tasks) in two weeks.  The way
we work together as a team also makes things quite fast.  Thus, a
project has to be quite deep in order to exceed a month of work.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>This post describes the hiring process of Aalto RSE.  The goal is to
make hiring more equitable by providing the background information so
that everyone can apply successfully.  For those not applying to us,
it might still provide some valuable insight about how to market your
skills as a PhD making a sideways career move.  What’s said here may
not apply to every organization, but it might give you some things to
think about.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This page is a rough average description of the past, not
a promise to always do this in the future.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Aalto RSE</span></a> has usually hired people who have postdoc
experience and will transition to a more applied
software/data/computing oriented role (as opposed to being focused on
writing papers).  For many people, we are the first experience of job
applications post-degree and thus people have to learn how to present
their skills in a new, non-academic context.</p>
<p>One should start by reading about us - we have lots of information
publicly available about what we do and how we think.  This should be
understood in order to do the next steps well.</p>
<p>The cover letter is the most important thing we read, and the first
and most important filter.  It’s read before the CV.</p>
<p>At the level we are at, almost everyone’s CV and achievements are
effectively equivalent.  Does it matter who got the most fancy papers?
Who has the most awards?  The classes people took?  When most of a
person’s knowledge has come from self-study, probably not.  The cover
letter is the chance to interpret your skills in the context of the
job you are applying for.</p>
<p>When reading the cover letter, the first question we ask is “does this
person know what they are applying to and know why they think they are
a good fit?”  (It’s always interesting to get letters which clearly
don’t understand the job, but on the other hand it’s an easy filter.)
The first paragraph should answer this question and that the rest of
the letter will go into detail about why.  Start with the most
important information, don’t make it hard for us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, talk about interests and skills as relevant to the
organization.  Discuss special projects, including non-academic ones
or random things that you are interested in (this is especially true
for us, since we are the transition from academia to practical work).
Our job advertisement gives you some specific ideas that you can talk
about.  Anything specifically important to the job should be pointed
out here and not just left in the CV.</p>
<p>If you don’t exactly fit the stated job requirements: here is the
chance to explain it.  The job requirement has to say roughly what we
need (to not waste people’s time when applying, and because our hiring
decisions must be justifiable based on the requirements), but there
are many cases where someone with a different experience can
accomplish our actual goal (as said in the job ad or found in your
background research).  A person that can say this, that they are
adaptable, and will have a very good chance.</p>
<p>We have adopted some system of anonymous recruiting.  We request that
cover letters are submitted without identifying information (name,
signature, etc) so that one person gives them numbers, and a broader
group tries to take a non-biased look at them.  After this initial
impression, we bring in the rest of the application.  Don’t make
assumptions about what the reader will know about your background,
just say it.</p>
<p>The letter should be as short as possible to get the information
across.  One page is usually about the shortest we get, and a bit less
than two pages is typical.  But if it’s engaging, we’ll read as much
as you write.  Remember, most important information first, don’t make
us hunt for things.</p>
<p>Update 2024: Do you want to use AI to write your cover letter?  Please
think again.  Since LLMs became a thing, cover letters have become
harder to read, longer, and more generic-sounding.  It’s better to
write in your own voice and be shorter than rely on what AI gives
you.</p>
<p>The CV serves as non-anonymous reference information, but they are
hard to read and all look pretty similar.  To be honest, we don’t
worry that much about the format and contents here: get us basic
factual information in the most efficient way.  For our particular
jobs, non-academic skills such as software/data tools are more
important than scientific articles, etc.   Remember, we are busy
and have plenty of applications, make it easy to read.</p>
<p>Open Science isn’t just good for research, it’s good for you, too.  If
you can point to public repositories of work you have done, this is
very useful.  Things like Gitlab/Github profiles with activity and
your own projects, links to data you have released, etc.  They don’t
have to be perfect - something is better than nothing.  The best case
would be a few projects which are well-done (and you know it and point
them out to us), and plenty more stuff that may be of lower quality to
show you can get simple stuff done simply.  Not everyone is fortunate
to have a field where they can practice open science throughout their
career, but even publishing a project or two before they apply for a
job with us is very useful.</p>
<p>Despite what the previous section said, we do try to dig through
applications that seem on-topic but don’t say everything we are looking
for, to give them the most fair shot we can.</p>
<p>We always need to heavily filter the list down.  Some relevant
filtering includes:</p>
<p>Do they know what job they are applying for?  Can they connect their
skills to the job?</p>
<p>Have they touched on the main points in our job advertisement and
the linked “<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/become-a-rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Become a RSE</span></a>” page?</p>
<p>Are they interested in teaching, mentoring, and real collaborative
projects?  Do they know what kind of teaching and mentoring we do?</p>
<p>Is there enough knowledge about the research process?</p>
<p>Any relevant skills about this call’s particular topic (if there is
any)?</p>
<p>How do their skills and experience match what our team is currently
missing, regardless of the open call?</p>
<p>How similar has their previous work been to “research engineering”
(helping the research process) instead of only focusing on academic
promotion?</p>
<p>The recruitment team makes several passes over and we discuss how to
filter down.  We try to get a good variety of candidates.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is some initial recorded “video interviews”, which
provide some initial familiarity in both directions before the actual
interviews.  We know these are non-interactive and a recording isn’t a
conversation so this is harder than an interview, but we consider that
when watching them.  One shouldn’t worry too much about these, if we
do them.</p>
<p>Our actual interviews are not designed to be stressful.  We have some
prepared questions and go through them in a friendly manner.  You have
a chance to ask questions to use at the beginning and end (and any
other time too).  The questions are designed to hear about your
experiences and not trick or test you.</p>
<p>We don’t currently ask technical challenge questions.  The number of
things which you’d need to know is so broad, it’s more important that
you can learn things quickly.  Since we usually interview relatively
advanced people, we can instead look at existing projects they have
done and check references, without having to do a technical
challenge.  This may change depending on the type of candidates we are
interviewing, but just like the main interviews we are more interested
in how people think, rather than raw knowledge.</p>
<p>In the future, there might be more “meet the team” kind of events.</p>
<p>We want to respond to people as soon as possible, but there’s a simple
fact: we don’t want to tell anyone “no” until we are very sure we have
an acceptance (we don’t want to tell someone “no” and then hire them
later), and we have very many qualified candidates.  So there is often
an unfortunately long delay in hearing back.  We hope that everyone
knows within a month, though (and ideally ~2 weeks if all goes well).</p>
<p>We get a relatively large number of applications, with a lot of good
people.  So far (before 2023), we have been hiring at a relatively
high level - researchers with postdoc experience who have been some
sort of RSE-like experience with helping others with research (beyond
only focusing on making papers for themselves) and technology.
Don’t let this discourage you.  There are many qualified applications,
so if you don’t get selected, that doesn’t mean that you were
unqualified.  We look at everyone, regardless of their level, for
every position.  The fit to our particular job is more important that
anything else, so keep trying until you get the right fit - it’s just
a numbers game.</p>
<p>For reference, this is an older job application text, so that you can
see how the things above are integrated.  (to be updated with the 2023
version soon)</p>

<p>Salary will be according to experience, for a recently graduated PhD
similar to a postdoc salary. Work hours are flexible, but are expected
to sync with the audience being served. Primary workplace is Otaniemi,
Espoo (Helsinki region), Finland. Aalto University has a hybrid work
policy which allows 60% remote work possibility, and our team takes good
advantage of this flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>To apply successfully</strong>:</p>
<p>Please include a separate cover letter (~1-2 pages). Please try to

<p>A normal professional or academic CV including</p>
<p>a list of your technical and programming tools and level of
proficiency (e.g. basic/proficient/expert). This is the time to
show the breadth of your experience.</p>
<p>Github link or other public sample code. If not available,
whatever is possible to demonstrate past programming
experience. Please highlight one or two of your outstanding
research software projects.</p>
