    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We had another development day (previous:
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../2023/march-development-day/"><span class="doc">ASC development day, 2023 March</span></a>).  It went mostly like the last one, and
we have less important news for the world, but below is the summary
anyway.</p>
<p>We have about 1550 people with accounts, with 202 new account
requests in the last six months.</p>
<p>Most routine issues tend to be about software installation, which is
good (this is the actually hard part, it’s good people ask us).</p>
<p>We are still on track for about 500 garage visits per year.  We
don’t try too hard to keep track of them all, we might get about 75%
of them.</p>
<p>The number of <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/interactive/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">interactive</span></a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/apps/jupyter/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Jupyter</span></a> users are increasing, while
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/usage/ood/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Open OnDemand</span></a> is decreasing.  This
is the wrong direction from what we’d like.  We will open
OOD to connections from all of Finland to make this easier.</p>
<p>Triton v3 is still on the way.  This isn’t a new cluster, but a new
operating system which individual nodes will be migrated to slowly
(while maintaining the same accounts and data).  Most of this happens
in the background, but the change of base operating system images will
require most code to be recompiled, which will require attention
from many users.  The transition can be made slowly, both old and new
OSs will run for a time being.  There won’t be a change in total
amount of computing power.</p>
<p>An upcoming blog post will discuss this more, and the effects on
users.  <em>Now is the time to start preparing.</em>  We still expect the
transition to happen sometime in the autumn.</p>
<p>We are thinking to merge home and scratch directories, to make a
common quota for both.  This would improve usability by reducing the
frequency of home quota affecting usage.  We’d welcome any other
usability suggestions.</p>
<p>Practically, we are using the chance to automate things even more,
which should make it easier to manage in the future.</p>
<p>Teaching has gone well.  For this academic year, we’d like to add back
in a few smaller, special-purpose courses (not just to teach them, but
also to get good quality video recordings for the future).</p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<p>Developing and delivering the “<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/ttt4hpc-2024/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">workflows</span></a>” course with CodeRefinery</p>
<p>Short courses to record (e.g. rerun of debug series, once a week,
record and publish).</p>
<p>Update <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/usage/debugging/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Debugging</span></a> linking the
different debugging course repositories.</p>
<p>LUMI is the new EU cluster with plentyful GPU resources.  A user can
essentially get as many GPU resources as they need with no waiting,
but since the GPUs are AMD, there is some initial barrier.  Our
general feeling remains: “we won’t recommend our users directly go and
use LUMI, but we recommend they talk with us first and we help them
use it”.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<p>Continue encouraging users to contact us.</p>
<p>RSEs will ask the top GPU user each week if they would like support
with taking LUMI into use.  We’ll go and do all the setup for them.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>This post describes the hiring process of Aalto RSE.  The goal is to
make hiring more equitable by providing the background information so
that everyone can apply successfully.  For those not applying to us,
it might still provide some valuable insight about how to market your
skills as a PhD making a sideways career move.  What’s said here may
not apply to every organization, but it might give you some things to
think about.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This page is a rough average description of the past, not
a promise to always do this in the future.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Aalto RSE</span></a> has usually hired people who have postdoc
experience and will transition to a more applied
software/data/computing oriented role (as opposed to being focused on
writing papers).  For many people, we are the first experience of job
applications post-degree and thus people have to learn how to present
their skills in a new, non-academic context.</p>
<p>One should start by reading about us - we have lots of information
publicly available about what we do and how we think.  This should be
understood in order to do the next steps well.</p>
<p>The cover letter is the most important thing we read, and the first
and most important filter.  It’s read before the CV.</p>
<p>At the level we are at, almost everyone’s CV and achievements are
effectively equivalent.  Does it matter who got the most fancy papers?
Who has the most awards?  The classes people took?  When most of a
person’s knowledge has come from self-study, probably not.  The cover
letter is the chance to interpret your skills in the context of the
job you are applying for.</p>
<p>When reading the cover letter, the first question we ask is “does this
person know what they are applying to and know why they think they are
a good fit?”  (It’s always interesting to get letters which clearly
don’t understand the job, but on the other hand it’s an easy filter.)
The first paragraph should answer this question and that the rest of
the letter will go into detail about why.  Start with the most
important information, don’t make it hard for us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, talk about interests and skills as relevant to the
organization.  Discuss special projects, including non-academic ones
or random things that you are interested in (this is especially true
for us, since we are the transition from academia to practical work).
Our job advertisement gives you some specific ideas that you can talk
about.  Anything specifically important to the job should be pointed
out here and not just left in the CV.</p>
<p>If you don’t exactly fit the stated job requirements: here is the
chance to explain it.  The job requirement has to say roughly what we
need (to not waste people’s time when applying, and because our hiring
decisions must be justifiable based on the requirements), but there
are many cases where someone with a different experience can
accomplish our actual goal (as said in the job ad or found in your
background research).  A person that can say this, that they are
adaptable, and will have a very good chance.</p>
<p>We have adopted some system of anonymous recruiting.  We request that
cover letters are submitted without identifying information (name,
signature, etc) so that one person gives them numbers, and a broader
group tries to take a non-biased look at them.  After this initial
impression, we bring in the rest of the application.  Don’t make
assumptions about what the reader will know about your background,
just say it.</p>
<p>The letter should be as short as possible to get the information
across.  One page is usually about the shortest we get, and a bit less
than two pages is typical.  But if it’s engaging, we’ll read as much
as you write.  Remember, most important information first, don’t make
us hunt for things.</p>
<p>Update 2024: Do you want to use AI to write your cover letter?  Please
think again.  Since LLMs became a thing, cover letters have become
harder to read, longer, and more generic-sounding.  It’s better to
write in your own voice and be shorter than rely on what AI gives
you.</p>
<p>The CV serves as non-anonymous reference information, but they are
hard to read and all look pretty similar.  To be honest, we don’t
worry that much about the format and contents here: get us basic
factual information in the most efficient way.  For our particular
jobs, non-academic skills such as software/data tools are more
important than scientific articles, etc.   Remember, we are busy
and have plenty of applications, make it easy to read.</p>
<p>Open Science isn’t just good for research, it’s good for you, too.  If
you can point to public repositories of work you have done, this is
very useful.  Things like Gitlab/Github profiles with activity and
your own projects, links to data you have released, etc.  They don’t
have to be perfect - something is better than nothing.  The best case
would be a few projects which are well-done (and you know it and point
them out to us), and plenty more stuff that may be of lower quality to
show you can get simple stuff done simply.  Not everyone is fortunate
to have a field where they can practice open science throughout their
career, but even publishing a project or two before they apply for a
job with us is very useful.</p>
<p>Despite what the previous section said, we do try to dig through
applications that seem on-topic but don’t say everything we are looking
for, to give them the most fair shot we can.</p>
<p>We always need to heavily filter the list down.  Some relevant
filtering includes:</p>
<p>Do they know what job they are applying for?  Can they connect their
skills to the job?</p>
<p>Have they touched on the main points in our job advertisement and
the linked “<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/become-a-rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Become a RSE</span></a>” page?</p>
<p>Are they interested in teaching, mentoring, and real collaborative
projects?  Do they know what kind of teaching and mentoring we do?</p>
<p>Is there enough knowledge about the research process?</p>
<p>Any relevant skills about this call’s particular topic (if there is
any)?</p>
<p>How do their skills and experience match what our team is currently
missing, regardless of the open call?</p>
<p>How similar has their previous work been to “research engineering”
(helping the research process) instead of only focusing on academic
promotion?</p>
<p>The recruitment team makes several passes over and we discuss how to
filter down.  We try to get a good variety of candidates.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is some initial recorded “video interviews”, which
provide some initial familiarity in both directions before the actual
interviews.  We know these are non-interactive and a recording isn’t a
conversation so this is harder than an interview, but we consider that
when watching them.  One shouldn’t worry too much about these, if we
do them.</p>
<p>Our actual interviews are not designed to be stressful.  We have some
prepared questions and go through them in a friendly manner.  You have
a chance to ask questions to use at the beginning and end (and any
other time too).  The questions are designed to hear about your
experiences and not trick or test you.</p>
<p>We don’t currently ask technical challenge questions.  The number of
things which you’d need to know is so broad, it’s more important that
you can learn things quickly.  Since we usually interview relatively
advanced people, we can instead look at existing projects they have
done and check references, without having to do a technical
challenge.  This may change depending on the type of candidates we are
interviewing, but just like the main interviews we are more interested
in how people think, rather than raw knowledge.</p>
<p>In the future, there might be more “meet the team” kind of events.</p>
<p>We want to respond to people as soon as possible, but there’s a simple
fact: we don’t want to tell anyone “no” until we are very sure we have
an acceptance (we don’t want to tell someone “no” and then hire them
later), and we have very many qualified candidates.  So there is often
an unfortunately long delay in hearing back.  We hope that everyone
knows within a month, though (and ideally ~2 weeks if all goes well).</p>
<p>We get a relatively large number of applications, with a lot of good
people.  So far (before 2023), we have been hiring at a relatively
high level - researchers with postdoc experience who have been some
sort of RSE-like experience with helping others with research (beyond
only focusing on making papers for themselves) and technology.
Don’t let this discourage you.  There are many qualified applications,
so if you don’t get selected, that doesn’t mean that you were
unqualified.  We look at everyone, regardless of their level, for
every position.  The fit to our particular job is more important that
anything else, so keep trying until you get the right fit - it’s just
a numbers game.</p>
<p>For reference, this is an older job application text, so that you can
see how the things above are integrated.  (to be updated with the 2023
version soon)</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We recently had an internal “development day”, which is a our new name
for getting together to talk about longer term plans.  This is our
second “development day”.  Overall, it went well, and we think that we
are on an overall  good path.  There are three particular focus areas
for the future:</p>
<p><strong>Teaching:</strong> This was also a focus last time, and probably will
still be in the future.  We are overall happy with our decision
last time to focus less on many small/medium courses, and instead
focus on large, collaborative courses and then focused,
individualized support for advanced use cases.  Smaller courses
happen mainly when we see specific needs that can’t be filled other
ways (or we make them large, open, collaborative courses if there
is a broad need).</p>
<p><strong>Triton v3:</strong> The software/OS/management side of our cluster will
be almost completely reworked in the next year (we aren’t getting
rid of any hardware just for this).  This will take a fair amount
of our time, but is needed because existing systems are starting to
show their age.</p>
<p><strong>LUMI usage:</strong> LUMI is a flagship project of EuroHPC and provides
huge resources available to the same people that can use Triton.
Triton is still needed for ease of use of everyday projects, but we
should actively look for people who can benefit from it and help
them port to there.  Our recent evaluations lead to the conclusion
that our porting help is still needed there.</p>
<p>Teaching has long been one of the pillars of ASC’s support.  It’s
still needed, but the focus seems to be changing.  No longer is a room
with 10-20 (or ever 50) people considered a lot.  People seem both
more able and willing to find advanced material themselves, and more
in need of basic principles (git, Python for SciComp, etc).  Perhaps
this is also partly caused by the remote work period emphasizing how
all this material is available online anyway.  Our basic philosophy:</p>
<p><strong>Focus on large courses for new researchers</strong>, for example using
the <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/coderefinery-mooc/">CodeRefinery MOOC strategy</a>.
This reaches the most people, helps the beginners the most,
produces high-quality open source material for asynchronous
reference, and has good possibilities for co-teaching.
Example include <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org">CodeRefinery</a>, our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2022-summer/">SciComp/HPC kickstart course</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/">Python for Scientific Computing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced, one-on-one, or small-group support</strong> via <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/">SciComp garage</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/">Research
Software Engineering service</a>.
This isn’t just for projects, but is also a useful service for
people learning from other advanced material in their work -
basically, we work as mentors.  One-on-one support is both more
rewarding for us and probably more useful to the user (relative to
time demands on both ends).  Anyway, advanced courses often aren’t
offered right when people need them, so we are left in this position
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>What about small/medium-sized courses, and advanced courses?</strong></p>
<p>The first two points above squeeze out medium-sized courses for
the most part, in our opinion.  By the time our audience is an
intermediate or advanced level, they seem to be able to figure
things out themselves + ask for help when needed - if they can
figure out what they need to do.  This point deserves further
study, though.  Instead, we point to other existing material.</p>
<p>We will make sure that we have good recommendations for advanced
self-study courses and generally chart out the resources so that our
users don’t have to.  This is mostly done by our <a class="reference external" href="https://hands-on.coderefinery.org">Hands-on Scientific
Computing</a> course.</p>
<p>In the past, we have supported community members to give courses on
topics of which they are experts.  Continue this as appropriate (see
the next point).</p>
<p>Continue the possibility of <strong>on-demand courses</strong> taught by us if
someone requests them, and other smaller courses if we see a strong
need.  Contact us!</p>
<p>Triton is our HPC cluster, and is notable for being a Ship of Theseus:
it’s continually upgraded while being the same cluster.  This has
resulted in the software running it getting a bit out of date.  This
software was originally developed as broader partnerships, and as
these partnerships have changed, we need to take more responsibility
for it ourselves.</p>
<p>Users shouldn’t see any major change from this, though part of it is
improving our (user) software installation tools, which should make
increased responsiveness to software installation requests.</p>
<p>As said above, Lumi is a significant resource, yet our users have not
come to us asking for our help in using it. Over the past six months, we
have found some Triton users who would benefit from it and helped
extend their workflows to work on LUMI.  We do this by first testing
some applications ourselves, then looking at Triton usage for large
users and reaching out directly.</p>
<p>Currently our focus is on GPU-intensive applications, which is made
more interesting because LUMI has AMD GPUs.  We’ve gotten local AMD
GPUs for our own testing and in general are well prepared to support
this.</p>
<p>While LUMI is a HPC system and has a typical HPC system interface, it
serves so many different users that the software stack is very
limited, so that most users need to install their own software and
figure out how to run it on AMD GPUs.  This is why we recommend most users
access LUMI through us (we’re paid to save you time, after all), though
of course anyone interested can use it directly.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We have stickers (and patches!) to support Aalto Scientific Computing.
(You can get them from our IT offices in CS, NBE, and Physics) But why
invest in this?  Well, it’s fun, but there should be a deeper reason.</p>
<p>While our main goal is to maintain Aalto University Triton HPC cluster,
provide courses and direct support to researchers, we cannot scale to
solve all problems and make the best decisions without a community: you!
Thus, our new promotional material is designed so that the members of our
community can show their support for scientific computing at Aalto
University.  We hope that by providing a way for the community to show
this interest, people can find - and support - each other better.</p>
<p>We have the typical hexagonal stickers, which you can use on all the typical
sticker things.</p>
<p>We also have patches, for those who are interested - in Finland they
are a big thing on [student
overalls](<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_boilersuit">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_boilersuit</a>), but you
could also sew them on your backpack or purse. Please send us pictures to
inspire us all! (some have Velcro backing for that kind)
of attachment, ask us for that style.</p>
<p>You may notice that for the patches some have a black background and
some have a white background.  <strong>Black-background means “Ask me
anything about the tools of scientific computing, I am happy to
help or at least point you the right direction (as much as I can)!”</strong></p>
<p>Here’s our idea:</p>
<p>Anyone may take the white background ones</p>
<p>Black background is for:</p>
<p>Aalto Scientific Computing team staff</p>
<p>Volunteers at our events (for example helpers at our workshops)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone who is interested in using their time to help others in
scientific computing (regardless of their skills)</strong></p>
<p>(clever people will notice that the first two are included in the
third, and actually anyone can be the third if they want).</p>
<p>The idea is that we, and our community, can’t work alone.  Everyone
needs to support each other in order to work at the level we want.
The in-group experts are an undervalued resource in this, often not
getting the credit or recognition they deserve in supporting
everyone.  This is our small method of recognizing those supporters,
and we hope that in the future we support them ever more - both
career-wise and supporting them in supporting others.</p>
<p>Yes, we should have gotten black-background stickers.  We’ll do that
next time…</p>
