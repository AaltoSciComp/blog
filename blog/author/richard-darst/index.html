    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Richard Darst visited UCL RSE to see what we can learn from them, and
learned the following from speaking to Jonathan Cooper, the Director
of Collaborations at ARC.  Thanks to Jonathan for checking and
improving this post.</p>
<p>The RSE team at UCL (“collaborations and consultancy”) is part of Advanced Research Computing Centre
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/">ARC</a>), which is a
department-level organization within the university.  Like Science-IT
at Aalto, it is not part of their IT Services, but also not part an
academic department/faculty: it’s sort of their own thing.  Overall,
they have around 120 people, of which about 60 are in the
“Collaborations Team”, which is basically the RSE side of things
(broader, as they have more professions, but the equivalent in type of
activity as the RSE side of Science-IT).  They are professional (not
academic career track) staff, but ARC does have some academic
affiliation which allows them to take part in academic teaching when
it’s needed.</p>
<p>The actual RSE work is part of “<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/collaborations-and-consultancy">Collaborations and Consultancy</a>”
and consists of jobs titles such as Data Scientists, Data Stewards,
Research Software Engineers, Digital Research Managers, and Research
Infrastructure Developers.  It is not that different from Aalto RSE
work, but their scale means they have more emphasis on large projects.
Many of their staff are assigned to various projects for months at a
time (usually more than one project, but not too many - actual
day-to-day time allocation is decided based on what works for each
project).  Many projects have a more senior and junior staff member
working together, or at least aware of the work.</p>
<p>Other sides of ARC are platforms &amp; services (HPC and many more
research-focused IT services) and teaching/training.  Overall, ARC and
ARC Collaborations are quite similar to Science-IT and Aalto RSE, but
at a much larger and more industrial scale, capable of helping very
many more people.</p>
<p>ARC’s RSE team has grown over the years.  It started in 2012 with 3
posts, and by around 2016-2017 it was 8 people and began growing very
rapidly.</p>
<p>I was especially interested in the work of RSE within research groups
(this was the original purpose of the meeting).  There are several
main strategies they use.</p>
<p>A project provides funding and ARC staff member(s) are deployed to
work on the project, scheduling as it makes sense. This is the most
common approach, for large and small projects. All ARC staff area
are on permanent contracts because when any given project funding
ends, they know there will be other projects available.  This is
what we have done with some flagship projects.</p>
<p>“Professional opportunities” - this is a special middle ground.
Someone is hired as a RSE to a research group, with ARC’s help in
recruitment.  They are paid and work within the group (with a job
title such as postdoc). ARC supports their work and makes sure it
goes well.  After the funding is over, the person is pre-approved to
join ARC permanently if they wish (assuming things have gone well,
which thanks to ARC’s help, they always do).</p>
<p>“Associate ARC membership” - people outside of ARC can become
associated and be part of chat channels, meetings, internal
trainings, etc.  This allows others to improve their research
engineering skills even without being employed by ARC.</p>
<p>Like we have found, they think that full time permanent employment is
best for professional RSE work.  Short-term contracts like postdocs
results in mixed motivations and constant turnover.  They have scale
so that they know people are always being hired, so that they can
essentially promise postdocs positions when they are done.  This
allows higher quality candidates and for them to focus on their RSE
work, not think about what (academic) job might come next.  They
currently (in 2025) have enough history to have approval to hire 6 new
staff each year (even without knowing exactly what projects they will
work on).</p>
<p>Just like at Aalto, one can also ask “should these staff better be
hired within research projects in academic departments?”  And just
like at Aalto, the answer is “yes, it could make sense - but these
departments aren’t current set up to teach, mentor, supervise,
promote, and keep RSE skills.”  Thus it’s a separate team, just like
at Aalto.</p>
<p>Overall, my evaluation is that if ARC is doing a lot of things right,
Aalto Science-IT is doing it right too.  There are implementation
differences as you might expect from the different national and
university environment.  My thoughts for the future are:</p>
<p>ARC RSE began growing very rapidly after about 5 years of existence
(6-8 staff/year).  Aalto RSE is that point now.</p>
<p>Hiring RSEs to research groups is possible, but is different than
hiring to a central team.  It requires close cooperation and thought
about their future career paths, otherwise the effect is only a bit
different from a postdoc.</p>
<p>Research computing is different than university IT Services, I like
the way UCL research computing is a different department, but
practically speaking I don’t think we can or should go towards that
now.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>What is a Research Software Engineer (RSE)?  Too many things to
define, you can find these definitions elsewhere.  Maybe the question
you would like to know is <strong>How do I get value from Research Engineers
like Aalto Scientific Computing does?</strong> - that’s what we’ll try to
answer here.  Through that, we may learn a functional definition.</p>
<p>This page is written from the perspective of <em>computational science</em> -
similar messages may apply to other fields.  Note that computing and
AI is in every field now.</p>
<p>When someone wants Research Engineers, it’s probably because they see
something that is missing in the current academic system.  Thus, to
understand what we want, we need to understand the system.  Below is
rkdarst’s current mental model:</p>
<p><strong>Academics</strong> are who we usually consider researchers.  They do
research, and are promoted based on articles published and citations
received from other academics.  Citations from academics tend to
focus on innovation and novelness, so that’s what decides career
paths.</p>
<p><strong>Research Engineers (REs)</strong> focus on the practice and “structural
integrity” of the research: the tools, the reproducibility, and
more.  They are more concerned with the work being done well, than
pure novelness and citations. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>0<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are a subset of Research
Engineers, and I feel that the “software” is the least significant
part there.  Software is important, but so is data, computing,
reproducibility, etc.</p>
<p>Particular examples of things that Research Engineers are good at
include: Reproduciblity, maintaining software and data across academic
generations, Open Science, programming, using large computer
clusters, data security, and research ethics processes.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers</strong>, in my mind, cover both of the above (and more).
Industrial research teams would have both of the above and possibly
even more different roles all working together on their problems.
In universities, we tend to only consider the academics to
researchers.</p>
<p>So what’s a Research Engineer?  To me, it’s defined mostly in terms of
what is missing from the typical academic career path (of
undergraduate → junior researcher → senior researcher).  At all
levels, I’ve seen research engineering under-valued and under-taught
(not necessarily because it’s not wanted, but because it’s not novel
science and there’s no time).  Senior researchers (group leaders)
often see the value, but don’t have the time (or sometimes ability) to
train and supervise research engineers well.</p>
<p>Years before Aalto RSE started (~2017-2018), I saw a need for more
basic skills (for example: version control to manage code) and worked
to promote them in undergraduate programs.  This basically didn’t
work, because they were seen as not scientific thus not something to
be taught in academic courses (and if they were thought, the courses
would be full of people looking for easy ECTS).  While there certainly
are study programs in software and software engineering, these are
their own thing, and not part of data science, or other fields that
need computation.  Software engineering programs also aren’t adapted
for the unpredictibility of research.</p>
<p>This was the prompting to start Aalto Research Software Engineers - if
we can’t teach people skills in study programs, we have to support
them when they become researchers (and teach it via practical
mentoring).  This has worked out very well, as you can see by our
rapid expansion and heavy usage.</p>
<p>Aalto RSE is essentially the collaborator our research groups need to
do their top-level work.  This system works very well, but are there
other options?</p>
<p>The above leads to various ideas.  Take your pick for what angle
you want to approach the problem:</p>
<p>Better RE teaching in undergraduate programs:</p>
<p>As part of existing programs (is there time to teach this?  Is
there desire?  On the other hand, RE skills are great for
employment prospects)</p>
<p>As dedicated majors? (Some people are trying to make dedicated RSE
study programs at different universities, and there is a value
there.  But if you ask me the best value is learning RE along with
academic research in a different field)</p>
<p>Better RE teaching in graduate programs:</p>
<p>Many of the same things as above apply here, mainly the lack of
time, and the necessity to spend time on novel research, not
learning existing best practices.</p>
<p>Nurture REs within existing research groups:</p>
<p>Nothing stops group leaders from hiring students and postdocs who
have chosen to focus on research engineering.  This often happens
when supervisors hire technical postdocs to manage the RE side of
things.  (The question is: can they be supervised and mentored
well by academic supervisors, if they need to be home-grown?)</p>
<p>If group leaders hire good candidates, Aalto RSE can help mentor
them.  See the companion blog post <a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">RSE work rotations</span></a>
for one idea.</p>
<p>Recruit REs as professor-level group leaders” similar to how senior
academics are recruited:</p>
<p>These people would focus on collaborating with others to make
projects possible.</p>
<p>The university systems don’t seem set up to value these people,
thus they don’t appear among the ranks.  They could appear if they
spent their careers chasing academic citations, but then would
they be able to spend enough time on research engineering?</p>
<p>I think this is what some people mean when they say they want a
RSE career path: a way to recruit senior academics who lead
research engineering groups.  I think the idea is good but it’s
not how universities are set up, so it’s a long way off.  The
values systems may not even match up.</p>
<p>Create parallel structures that support research engineering</p>
<p>That is what Aalto RSE has done.  We are researchers, but we make
new research possible by collaborating with academics, instead of
trying to publish by ourselves.  We are part of the services of
the School of Science.</p>
<p>We also take it upon ourselves to do teaching and mentoring via
co-working for all types of researchers (aspiring academic or
research engineer).  We can fill in the technical mentoring that’s
missing by many supervisors.</p>
<p>You can read about <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/history/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">our history</span></a> in
more detail.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many people interested in gaining research engineering
competence for their organization.  You need to develop an environment
where they fill in the gaps you need.</p>
<p>Junior academics: encourage them to explore their technical skills.
Show that there is value in this, even if it reduces the number of
publications.  Encourage them to get training (for example the Aalto
RSE training).  Give them time, encouragement, and career prospects
to reach beyond the focus on papers.</p>
<p>Other support staff at universities and other organizations: don’t
view them as limited-purpose supporters of an {infrastructure,
service, process}.  View them as supporters of research: let them
holistically support research projects from many angles at once,
rather than only in narrow silos with strict project reporting
requirements.</p>
<p>You can hire dedicated staff to be REs, but it’s important that they
are integrated into the local research environment.  Most of our
hires have been local staff who have grown into a new role, and I
think this is how it should be.</p>
<p>Any of the above, especially the first two, require time being made
available for RE work and a clear vision and network.  Aalto RSE (with
the help of others in Finland) is planning on making a networking and
onboarding program for new research engineers who wish to adopt this
vision.</p>
<p>If you read this far, you probably see the value in research engineers
and want them yourself.  Just hiring someone, or changing someone’s
job to “RSE”, won’t magically solve the problem you need.  It’s a
whole mindset shift towards a multi-disciplinary research team.</p>
<p>What’s the right level of research engineers, permanent and
experienced or junior and learning?  Probably a bit of both.</p>
<p>I know that “Research Engineer” is a job title that can have
other definitions.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We occasionally get some questions: how busy is the cluster?  How
long do I have to wait?  Is there some dashboard that can tell me?</p>
<p>The answer is, unfortunately, not so easy.  <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Our cluster</span></a> uses dynamic scheduling with a fairshare algorithm.
All users have a fairshare priority, which decreases the more you have
recently run.  Jobs are ranked by priority (including fairshare plus
other factors), and scheduled in that order.  If there are
unschedulable holes between those jobs, it can take a job with a lower
priority and fill them in (“backfilling”).  So that gives us:</p>
<p>A small-enough job with a low priority might still be scheduled
soon.</p>
<p>A higher priority user could submit something while you are waiting,
and increase your wait time.</p>
<p>An existing job could end early, making other wait times shorter.</p>
<p>An existing job could end early, allowing some other higher priority
jobs to run sooner, making backfilled jobs run later.</p>
<p>In short: there is no way to give an estimate of the wait time, in the
way people want.  We’ve tried but haven’t find a way to answer the
question well.</p>
<p>What can we know?</p>
<p>You can compare your fairshare factor with other users.  If you run
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sshare</span></code> you can see the fairshare (higher means higher priority).
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sprio</span></code> shows relatively priority for all jobs (here, the raw values
are multiplied by some factor and added).  On Triton (the new install
since 2024 may), they mean the following:</p>
<p>at 7 days) (zero when first submitted, increasing to 10000 at 7
days old)</p>
<p>The fairshare factor is “1e7 × FairShare priority from sshare”</p>
<p>The FairShare value is computed based on the raw usage value: at
each level of the share tree, it divides it up among the users so
that those who have run less have a higher priority.</p>
<p>The usage value decays with a two-week half life.</p>
<p>The others are mostly constant.</p>
<p>Still: this is all very abstract and what others submit has more
effect than your priority.  The only thing you can control is using
less resources.</p>
<p>This is quite cluster dependent so we’d recommend asking for help for
how your own cluster is setup.</p>
<p>This may be your real question. There are two main things:</p>
<p>Use less resources.  <strong>Make sure you don’t over-request more than
you need (CPU, memory, GPUs)</strong> - this will affect your future
fairshare less. Of course, use everything you need, “saving for
later” doesn’t give you more resources than you save now.</p>
<p>Request less resources per job.  This will let you be backfilled
into the scheduling holes (see below).</p>
<p>In this case, if there is a slot for you, you are scheduled very soon.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">srun</span> <span class="pre">--test</span> <span class="pre">[RESOURCE_REQUESTS]</span></code> might give you some hint about
when a job would be scheduled - it basically tries to schedule an
empty job and reports the currently estimated start time. (It uses a
JobID though so don’t run it in a loop)</p>
<p>In this case, nothing can be said since the queue is always being
re-shuffled.  In the long-run, you get a fair share of resources.  If
you haven’t used much lately, you have more now.  Your wait time
depends more on what other users submit (and their priorities) than
what you submit - and this is always changing.  You can tell something
about how soon you’d be scheduled by looking at your priority relative
to other users.  Make your jobs as small and efficient as possible to
fit in between the holes of other jobs and get scheduled as soon as
possible.  If you can break one big job into smaller pieces (less
time, less CPU, less memory) that depend on each other, then you can
better fit in between all of the big jobs.  See the <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/TTT4HPC_resource_management/scheduling/">Tetris metaphor
here in TTT4HPC</a></p>
<p>If your need is “run stuff quickly for testing”, make sure the jobs
are as short as possible.  Hopefully, your cluster staff about
development or debugging partitions that may be of use, because that’s
the solution for quick tests.</p>
<p>This description was in an old version of our docs but has since been
removed.  The exact values are out of date.  It’s included here for
detailed reference anyway:</p>
<p>Triton queues are not first-in first-out, but “fairshare”.  This means
that every person has a priority.  The more you run the lower your
user priority.  As time passes, your user priority increases again.
The longer a job waits in the queue, the higher its job priority goes.
So, in the long run (if everyone is submitting an never-ending stream
of jobs), everyone will get exactly their share.</p>
<p>Once there are priorities, then: jobs are scheduled in order of
priority, then any gaps are backfilled with any smaller jobs that can
fit in.  So small jobs usually get scheduled fast regardless.</p>
<p><em>Warning: from this point on, we get more and more technical, if you
really want to know the details.  Summary at the end.</em></p>
<p>What’s a share?  Currently shares are based on department and their
respective funding of Triton (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sshare</span></code>).  It used to be that
departments had a share, and then each member had a share of that
department.  But for complex reasons we have changed it so that it’s
flat: so that each person has a share, and the shares of everyone in a
department corresponds to that department’s share.  When you are below
your share (relative to everyone else), you have higher priority, and
vice versa.</p>
<p>Your priority goes down via the “job billing”: roughly time×power.
CPUs are billed at 1/s (but older, less powerful CPUs cost less!).
Memory costs .2/GB/s.  But: you only get billed for the max of memory
or CPU. So if you use one CPU and all the memory (so that no one else
can run on it), you get billed for all memory but no CPU.  Same for
all CPUs and little memory.  This encourages balanced use.  (this also
applies to GPUs).</p>
<p>GPUs also have a billing weight, currently tens of times higher than a
CPU billing weight for the newest GPUs.  (In general all of these can
change, for the latest info see search <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BillingWeights</span></code> in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/slurm/slurm.conf</span></code>).</p>
<p>If you submit a long job but it ends early, you are only billed for
the actual time you use (but the longer job might take longer to start
at the beginning).  Memory is always billed for the full reservation
even if you use less, since it isn’t shared.</p>
<p>The “user priority” is actually just a record how much you have
consumed lately (the billing numbers above).  This number goes down
with a half-life decay of 2 weeks.  Your personal priority your share
compared to that, so we get the effect described above: the more you
(or your department) runs lately, the lower your priority.</p>
<p>If you want your stuff to run faster, the best way is to more
accurately specify your time (may make that job can find a place
sooner) and memory (avoids needlessly wasting your priority).</p>
<p>While your job is pending in the queue SLURM checks those metrics
regularly and recalculates job priority constantly.  If you are
interested in details, take a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html">multifactor priority plugin</a> page (general
info) and <a class="reference external" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor3.html">depth-oblivious fair-share factor</a> for what we
use specifically (warning: very in depth page).  On Triton, you can
always see the latest billing weights in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/slurm/slurm.conf</span></code></p>
<p>Numerically, job priorities range from 0 to 2^32-1.  Higher is
sooner to run, but really the number doesn’t mean much itself.</p>
<p>These commands can show you information about your user and job
priorities:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">s</span></code></p>
<p>list of jobs per user with their current priorities</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">full</span></code></p>
<p>as above but almost all of the job parameters are listed</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">shares</span></code></p>
<p>displays usage (RawUsage) and current FairShare weights (FairShare, higher is better) values for all users</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sshare</span></code></p>
<p>Raw data of the above</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sprio</span></code></p>
<p>Raw priority of queued jobs</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">j</span> <span class="pre">&lt;jobid&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>shows <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;jobid&gt;</span></code> detailed info including priority, requested nodes etc.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Just select the resources you think you need, and Slurm
tries to balance things out so everyone gets their share.  The best
way to maintain high priority is to use resources efficiently so you
don’t need to over-request.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Let’s say you want to start a Research (Software) Engineer team in
your own unit.  How do you set your new hires off on the right
path?  A proposal is outlined below.</p>
<p>This is a companion post to <a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-collaboration/"><span class="doc">Future RSE collaboration in Finland</span></a>.</p>
<p>You need to find the right person to hire for the role.  Most likely,
this means someone with the skills you need but the mindset to
transition from their own work to making other work possible.  You can
find hiring resources on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">the Aalto RSE page</span></a> and some brief thoughts in the companion post
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-collaboration/"><span class="doc">Future RSE collaboration in Finland</span></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have hired someone.  What’s next?</p>
<p>This proposal is much easier for someone inside of Aalto University
than outside, but possibly could be negotiated for others.</p>
<p>Your new hire works as part of the existing School of Science RSE
team initially, perhaps ~1 year.</p>
<p>The hire is paid, organizationally supervised in, and sits in your
own unit.  It is absolutely critical that they maintain close
connections to your own unit, the membership in our team is only
virtual.  (Our team is remote-first, so this is easy).</p>
<p>They focus on projects from your own unit, but as part of our daily
flow.  This could mean asking your audience to join our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a> for help and requesting that new big
projects come via our project management systems.</p>
<p>Your new hire will learn all about how we work.</p>
<p>Your new hire will experience a tremendous diversity of projects and
work with experts on them.</p>
<p>After the initial ~1 year period, we sit down and decide what is
next.  Does your new hire stay working as part of our team (with a
greater focus on your own unit’s projects)?  Or do they split off
and start doing their own thing in your unit?  Or some combination?</p>
<p>This gives you the most important part of our onboarding and training.
There is no better way to develop the right mindset.  If we split
later, your staff will know who to ask for harder problems that come
up later.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>The Aalto University School of Science has a successful
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Research Software Engineering service</span></a>
serving the whole university.  This service has proven its value and
there are an increasing number of questions of how others can form
their own teams in Finland and work together.  This post gives some
thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>This page is the opinion of the author and not Aalto itself.  It’s not
an open offer for collaboration.  The author is happy to help with any
questions you may have (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">first.last&#64;aalto.fi</span></code> or various chat
systems).</p>
<p>Universities have academics: the traditional core, making ideas and
new results.  Much research, even not “computer science”, needs
computational tools.  However, the skills needed even for basic
computation can be so complex that not all academics can master it to
do cutting-edge research.  A Research (Software) Engineer (RSE) can
bridge that gap: academics focus on their primary work, and the RSE
makes the computing seamless.</p>
<p>For more info, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Aalto RSE site</span></a>.
This is not that different from research engineers supporting complex
physical equipment.</p>
<p>We’ve found there are plenty of qualified people to hire.  The harder
part is mentoring them to transition from a researcher (focused on
single projects with emphasis on own publications) to supporter
(supporting a wide variety of people with respect and compassion).
This transition needs active mentoring.</p>
<p>See the companion post about
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">work rotations for RSE mentoring</span></a> -
if you are in Aalto University then start there.</p>
<p>You should decide if you want (a) wide-ranging support which may
include helping with basics or (b) specialist support for a
limited audience.  I would argue that our most important impact is
(a): this has gotten us the most benefit overall, and a steady stream
of more advanced projects as work advances.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want your own RSE team at your own organization.  How
can you and Aalto RSE work together?</p>
<p>Even without joint funding, some of us Aalto people would be happy to
talk and give some advice, and be part of a broader general network.
For example:</p>
<p>How our team works, what makes it work, advice for your team</p>
<p>Joint RSE seminars to build skills, for example as part of
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/tech/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>FCCI Tech (aka the SciComp Tech series)</span></a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://nordic-rse.org/events/seminar-series/">Nordic-RSE seminar series</a>, or something new.
Both of these are good for professional development and community.</p>
<p>All the advice and practices on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">the Aalto RSE site</span></a>.</p>
<p>Professional networking and so on.</p>
<p>However, without funding, Aalto needs to focus on its own work.</p>
<p>With joint funding, it might be possible to make a collaboration.</p>
<p>Any higher level collaboration needs to be discussed with management.
Assuming these discussions go well, we might join a collaboration
together so that we can actually share projects between the team.
There should always be a strong local presence, because
that gets the best value.  This opens more possibilities.</p>
<p>The more experienced or larger teams could provide:</p>
<p>Mentoring possibilities for new research engineers and their teams
(see <a class="reference internal" href="../../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">RSE work rotations</span></a>).</p>
<p>A base for professional networking.</p>
<p>A larger base of knowledge, for more advice and help with specialist
problems.  A very important part of our team is that for almost any
problem, someone has seen it and can solve it quickly.  Then we
train others to solve it.</p>
<p>Joint support sessions such as our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a>,
which allowed a wider support base for problems, covering the
previous point.</p>
<p>The newer or smaller teams could provide:</p>
<p>Funding via some joint project.</p>
<p>More staff around to help fill in the gaps when needed (these staff
also get training in these projects they experience).</p>
<p>Specialty domain knowledge (both for support of academics and for
professional development).</p>
<p>A collaboration with larger funding could have a joint project flow:
there is one place to submit new projects requests, and the right
people in any organization will work on them.</p>
<p>We would welcome observers in our support sessions, especially from
other staff at Aalto.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://nordic-rse.org/about/getinvolved/">Nordic-RSE chat</a> is also a good way to
ask questions and see what we are up to for those outside Aalto
University.</p>
<p>We know of various opportunities being considered for national
(Finland) or international RSE collaborations.  The above are some
basic thoughts, but any model would be tailored to the actual funding
and partners.  There is definitely a benefit to starting off
together.</p>

<p>It has the same name, and importantly the same user accounts and data,
but all the software and operating system is changed.  In particular:</p>
<p>All software modules are different</p>
<p>Any software which has been complied will need to be re-compiled.</p>
<p>Triton’s previous operating system was released in 2014.  Security
support runs out at the end of 2024 May, and it <em>has</em> to be updated.
Stability is good for research, so we try to reduce the number of
changes (compare)</p>
<p>We realize that a change is very disruptive and painful, especially
since the expectation is that Triton never changes.  But an old
operating system makes problem for users too, and they have gotten
more and more over the years.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>When updating Triton, many users will get a message like this (or
similar things if you use other SSH clients like PuTTY):</p>
<p>SSH (Secure SHell) is made to be secure, and that means one it
verifies the server you are connecting <strong>to</strong> via its <strong>ssh host
key</strong>.  The representation of this key is the <strong>fingerprint</strong>, like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SHA256:OqCehC2lbHdl8mYGI/G9vlxTwew3H3KrvxKDkwIQy9Y</span></code>.  This means
that the NSA or someone can’t intercept the connecting and get your
password by pretending to be Triton.  This is a good thing.</p>
<p>OpenSSH (the command line program on Linux, MacOS, Windows) saves
these connection IDs (fingerprints) in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts</span></code>.  Other programs may store the keys
somewhere else.</p>
<p>The warning looks scary but the first thing to ask is “should the
server I am connecting to have changed?”.  If you have been directed
to this blog post, then probably yes, it has.  You should <em>always</em>
think if the fingerprint should change, and if there is no reason for
them to have changed, contact your administrators.  You can usually
verify the keys online, for example
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/usage/ssh-fingerprints/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Triton ssh key fingerprints</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you are on command line OpenSSH (Linux), it will propose a command
that will remove the old host key:</p>
<p>For other programs, follow whatever prompts it might give to replace
the host key fingerprint.</p>
<p>When you get a “The authenticity of host ‘triton.aalto.fi’ can’t be
established”, verify the SSH key fingerprints that are presented, then
click “yes” to permanently save them (until they change next, they can
always be updated).  The fingerprints for Triton v3 are:</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>The “Research Software Engineer” service provides technical
collaborators for researchers to complement their scientific
knowledge.  <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Read about Aalto RSE here</span></a>.
The idea of this service was that it would be available to everyone,
but some projects who made extensive use would fund it themselves.</p>
<p>If you are a group leader reading this, Aalto RSE can help you release
research code, debug it, make it reusable, rescue old code from former
members and make it usable again, make it run on our cluster or CSC’s
clusters, manage data, prepare data for easy use, and so on.  If it’s
not long (less than a month), our work is free, if it’s more than a
month, the below applies.</p>
<p>When we started, we hoped for around 50% project funding.  The idea
was that a lot of the funding for the service would come from the
research projects themselves.  This hasn’t really worked out so well,
because a) we accomplish the vast majority of our projects quickly, in
less than a few weeks, and b) finance would understandably not like to
deal with small transactions for small amounts of time.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that we basically have received only a small amount of the
project funding we would have wanted.  On the other hand, this also
means we have supported a far wider variety of projects than we would
have otherwise.  It also means we are better accomplishing our other
goal: tactical support right where and when it’s needed most, with the
least amount of administrative overhead.  This actually better matches
our mission of helping the researchers who need us most.</p>
<p>For any <strong>long projects</strong> (more than a month or so), we still follow
do our original plan: we can receive funding from grants (or basic
funding) to do long-term projects.  This is usually 40-80% of a RSE’s
time, spread out over more than a month (and it can also be bursty:
lots of work at some times, waiting for the next task at other times).
We have done this for projects, and we know we can do it in the
future.</p>
<p>But there’s another thing that has worked well: <strong>retainer</strong>-type
funding instead of project-based funding.  You have extra funding that
needs to be used?  You know your group needs support but you can’t
name a single specific project to use all the time?  Hire RSEs on
long-term retainers and we’re there for you as needed.  <strong>You will
always get priority for all the quick questions you have</strong> (in
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a> or otherwise), and you get the highest
priority for your medium projects, we can attend your other group
meetings, and so on.  As your team wants, we’ll make high-impact
improvements here and there.  This could be (for example) anywhere
from 10-40% time over a long period.</p>
<p>We <em>have</em> worked out how to do both one-off projects and retainers
with Finance.  As for as external funders are concerned, our staff
count as researchers, so we can use any funding you might have.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you have a project or want us on retainer, let us
know:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Research Software Engineers</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/how-we-work/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Starting a project with us</span></a>.</p>
<p>This is a valid questions.  Compared to many RSE groups, we seem to be
focusing on many small questions for a broad audience that knows a lot
about the problems they need to solve.  Thus, we can come in to
something already set up well, provide help, and mostly back off and
be available for maintenance long-term.  The units that fund us
(schools, departments) have been happy with this, so we’ve kept it up.
On the other hand, we are pretty fast.  There have been projects where
a summer worker was going to be hired, that we could end up doing
(learning the framework + all the main tasks) in two weeks.  The way
we work together as a team also makes things quite fast.  Thus, a
project has to be quite deep in order to exceed a month of work.</p>

<p><em>This was originally written in June 2023 but publication was

<p>The course has run since around 2015 or so.  Until mid 2020, it was always
in-person only.  Until (and including) 2022, it ran twice a year,
January and June, but now it runs only in June (increased availability
of videos + the material compensates).  It runs in June so that it
aligns with new summer research interns starting.  Until around 2020,
it was mostly about using the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">HPC cluster at Aalto

computing and the big picture of things.</p>
<p>Our general feedback remains quite positive.  Our streaming +
coteaching + collaborative notes format is still well received, and
there seems to be little reason to go back for courses of smaller
scale.  Instead of just lectures, written material (tutorials in info
on scicomp.aalto.fi) + livestream + videos is a good combination.</p>
<p>There is never enough time - not much else to say.  Each year there is
a different trade-off between how much we cover and how brief we are.
(There are always people who say we should go more in-depth, and some
who say we go too much in-depth.  Such is life.)</p>
<p>Repetition is good, but not when it’s a sign that we can’t stop
talking and keep saying the same thing over and over.  The best
lessons seemed to be the ones that were taught most quickly, since it
has a high density of new information.  We should strive to make more
lessons faster, and leave details to the reading.</p>
<p>Because the teachers also do support, for anything difficult, we can
easily tell learners: “Do what you can, come by our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/#garage" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-ref">SciComp garage</span></a> to ask for help with anything
else.  This overall reduces the demands from teaching: a person
doesn’t have to know everything, but know enough to get started and to
know when they may need more help for more advanced tools.  This
really is good for both of us.</p>
<p>As usual, we expected our learners to read our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/">shell crash course</a> in advance.  We also had
a new tutorial on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/cluster-shell/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">using the cluster from the shell</span></a>.  This helped some, but it was still a
problem.</p>
<p>Reflection: this will always be a problem in any course that has a
wide enough audience.  We should accept and provide positive support
for those not ready, and not try to exclude them.  It’s OK to see a
course and then strive to get the prerequisites later.</p>
<p>Internally, we had this thought of dividing the course in two: a basic
part at the start of the summer, and an advanced part at the end of
the summer -
since brand new researchers may have trouble understanding
everything.  On the other hand, the fact we have videos means that
people can come back and review the material when they are ready.  So
in some sense, learners can divide the course however they would like
by stopping when they think it’s no longer necessary and coming back.
This could be mentioned more explicitly in our introductions.</p>
<p>Attendance goes down day-by-day.  This is definitely OK - it doesn’t
hurt anyone.  It’s expected that day 1 was suitable for the most
people (even those not doing HPC work), and then the course topics got
continually more specific as we went further and further.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this is even be expected and encouraged - better
to have someone attend day 1, than not.</p>
<p>Our exercises are quite basic overall, but we got few complains about
this.  Basic exercises are better than something too advanced or
realistic, that requires many things to come together.</p>
<p>This year, we tried to have a complete solution for every exercise
(script and/or commands), even if it’s directly said above in the
lesson.  This seemed to be good, since for people very short of time,
they still have some chance to copy and paste and do the exercises.
For those passively following, they can at least see what would have
been done.</p>
<p>Day 3 / end of course feedback positive feedback (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code> is the way a
person votes for/agrees with that option:</p>
<p>it’s great that the material is so easily accessible also after the
course to go through things in my own pace again oo</p>
<p>Really good format with the streaming and the shared document for
questions. ooooo</p>
<p>The cat kept me focused in the lecture</p>
<p>Live interaction with the instructes were very helpful and exercises were nice</p>
<p>I really appreaciate the instructors took the time to explain the
jargons, instead of just letting them fly around. o</p>
<p>The fact that the instructors were really nice contributed to the
good course experience. Thanks for that! o</p>
<p>(day 1) After studying remotely for 1,5 year and having lots of
online classes, I highly appreciate the amazing audio quality
here. Many thanks for that!</p>
<p>(day 1) The framework is better than any other workshop I’ve ever
attended - in terms of interaction and audio quality. HackMD is
great.</p>
<p>(day 1) The (twitch) vertical screen thing is genius and should be
used in way more (online) lectures o</p>
<p>Most common negative feedback: not enough time! In fact, that’s
almost only thing to improve. Except we can’t, so I think we win
pretty well. And videos/material allows follow-up.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We had another development day (previous:
<a class="reference internal" href="../../../2023/march-development-day/"><span class="doc">ASC development day, 2023 March</span></a>).  It went mostly like the last one, and
we have less important news for the world, but below is the summary
anyway.</p>
<p>We have about 1550 people with accounts, with 202 new account
requests in the last six months.</p>
<p>Most routine issues tend to be about software installation, which is
good (this is the actually hard part, it’s good people ask us).</p>
<p>We are still on track for about 500 garage visits per year.  We
don’t try too hard to keep track of them all, we might get about 75%
of them.</p>
<p>The number of <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/interactive/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">interactive</span></a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/apps/jupyter/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Jupyter</span></a> users are increasing, while
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/usage/ood/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Open OnDemand</span></a> is decreasing.  This
is the wrong direction from what we’d like.  We will open
OOD to connections from all of Finland to make this easier.</p>
<p>Triton v3 is still on the way.  This isn’t a new cluster, but a new
operating system which individual nodes will be migrated to slowly
(while maintaining the same accounts and data).  Most of this happens
in the background, but the change of base operating system images will
require most code to be recompiled, which will require attention
from many users.  The transition can be made slowly, both old and new
OSs will run for a time being.  There won’t be a change in total
amount of computing power.</p>
<p>An upcoming blog post will discuss this more, and the effects on
users.  <em>Now is the time to start preparing.</em>  We still expect the
transition to happen sometime in the autumn.</p>
<p>We are thinking to merge home and scratch directories, to make a
common quota for both.  This would improve usability by reducing the
frequency of home quota affecting usage.  We’d welcome any other
usability suggestions.</p>
<p>Practically, we are using the chance to automate things even more,
which should make it easier to manage in the future.</p>
<p>Teaching has gone well.  For this academic year, we’d like to add back
in a few smaller, special-purpose courses (not just to teach them, but
also to get good quality video recordings for the future).</p>
<p>Goals:</p>
<p>Developing and delivering the “<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/ttt4hpc-2024/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">workflows</span></a>” course with CodeRefinery</p>
<p>Short courses to record (e.g. rerun of debug series, once a week,
record and publish).</p>
<p>Update <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/usage/debugging/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Debugging</span></a> linking the
different debugging course repositories.</p>
<p>LUMI is the new EU cluster with plentyful GPU resources.  A user can
essentially get as many GPU resources as they need with no waiting,
but since the GPUs are AMD, there is some initial barrier.  Our
general feeling remains: “we won’t recommend our users directly go and
use LUMI, but we recommend they talk with us first and we help them
use it”.</p>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<p>Continue encouraging users to contact us.</p>
<p>RSEs will ask the top GPU user each week if they would like support
with taking LUMI into use.  We’ll go and do all the setup for them.</p>
<p>Slide on infoscreens around the buildings?</p>

    </ul>
    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Recently, a <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.isosceles.com/the-webp-0day/">major security vulnerability (CVE-2023-5129)</a> has been
found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libwebp</span></code>, an image decoding library for the <cite>.webp</cite> format.
This is major, since this library is embedded in many apps and web
browsers and allows remote code execution just by opening a file.  For
computational scientists, there is still some impact - and it’s harder
to compensate for.  In short, just by processing an image in the .webp
format, someone can take over your computer or session.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libwebp</span></code> is the current issue, but the problem is general:
<strong>computational scientists often create software environments and use
them for a long
time.  These environments aren’t usually browsing the web (the most
likely attack vector here), but they do involve lots of code installed
from different projects.  How does one manage security in this case?</strong></p>
<p><em>This post may be updated</em></p>
<p>If you use web browsers or apps on your own desktops, laptops, phones,
etc. - make sure update them!</p>
<p>If you don’t use images in your research, there probably isn’t much
impact.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em>, this is what could happen:</p>
<p>You make a Python / Anaconda environment which uses <cite>libwebp</cite>
somehow - directly installed through Conda, or some other
application.</p>
<p>You download a dataset containing images.  You process them as part
of your research with the old environment.</p>
<p>The malicious image runs an exploit.  It has access to your whole
user account on that computer: extract any data, add SSH keys for
remote access, corrupt/delete data (which might not be backed up
from the cluster…).</p>
<p>Many things have to happen here, but it’s very possible for it to
happen.  You could <strong>lose access to non-backed up data or code</strong> or
<strong>other confidential or sensitive data could be compromised</strong>, since
code from one project from your user account has access to all
projects from your account.</p>
<p>One would normally fix things by updating software.  But when you are
dealing with a research environment that can’t easily be updated, what
should you do?  This is the real question here.</p>
<p>It’s a multi-layered problem, and the answer will depend on your
work.  <strong>libwebp is what we are thinking about now, but the problem is
general: there are other security problems that occasionally come up
that can affect more scientific code.  How do you prepare for next time?</strong></p>
<p>Update your environments (conda, virtualenv, etc).  You could try to
see if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libwebp</span></code> is inside of them (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span> <span class="pre">list</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">grep</span> <span class="pre">webp</span></code>),
but especially for Pip packages it might not be apparent.</p>
<p>Make your environments reproducible: If you define your dependencies
in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">requirements.txt</span></code> (Python), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">environment.yml</span></code> (conda), or
whatever is suitable for your language, you can easily re-generate
environments to bring everything up to date.  (delete old one,
re-create).</p>
<p>If you pin versions of dependencies (like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">numpy==1.20.0</span></code>), it’s
possible it can pull in older versions of other dependencies.</p>
<p>Containerize your workflows.  If code runs inside of a container, it
keeps it isolated from the rest of the operating system and user
account.  (but containers aren’t usually designed for strict
security, but it’s better than nothing).</p>
<p>If you use pre-built modules on the cluster, try not to use old
versions.  We’ll update some recent modules, but we can’t update all
of the old ones.  At least <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">webp</span></code> is in the default <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">anaconda</span></code>
modules.</p>
<p>If you write or maintain software in general, keep it up to date as
much as reasonable!  Don’t make others get into a place where they
are having to use old versions of libraries to make it work.</p>
<p>In general, think about your dependencies.  Be at least a little bit
suspicious before you install random other software, that may
possibly pull in lots of other dependencies.  Of course, as a
researcher, you may not have much choice.</p>
<p>These commands seem to be able to update an environment to a newer
libwebp.  It <em>seems</em> to work on newer environments, but we don’t know
for sure.  Instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mamba</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">conda</span></code> in theory works but is to
slow it may not be practical:</p>
<p>There is a major security vulnerability in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">libwebp</span></code>.  While the
impact on computational scientists may not be <em>that</em> much, a bigger
issue is the difficulty of keeping all of the environments up to date
so that next time this happens, it’s easier to respond.</p>
<p>We hope to have more security recommendations for computational
scientists in the future.  If anyone is interested in collaborating on
this, let us know.</p>
<p>Common apps which embed Chrome or libwebp: Chrome, Firefox, VSCode,
Zulip, Slack, Discord… things that use Electron to embed a web
browser are affected, and that’s <em>many</em> things.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>From 2023-09-25, publicly accessible Aalto server login is changing
and will now require a password in addition to SSH keys.  This will
have a significant usability impact on some users.  This post is made
as a landing page for users who need immediate, practical help and for
whom the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/ssh-connections-to-public-linux-servers-from-outside-the-aalto-network-will-require-both-a-password">aalto.fi page</a>
isn’t findable or detailed enough.  The official contact is the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-service-desk-contact-information-and-service-hours">IT
Services service desk</a></p>
<p>The reference page <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/ssh/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>SSH</span></a> has been updated to
include detailed reference information for every common operating
system and SSH client.  Secure Shell is one of the standard methods of
connecting to remote servers and it is important that users of all
skill levels are able to use it securely.</p>
<p>This change is <em>not</em> from Science-IT, but since it will affect many of
our users but is not being publicized or supported very much, we are
preemptively doing some major user support.</p>
<p>What is <strong>not</strong> happening is: requiring locally encrypted SSH keys (although this is highly recommended).</p>
<p>What <strong>is</strong> happening: When you connect to an SSH server from outside
Aalto networks, you will need to have an SSH key set up <strong>and</strong> send
your Aalto password to the remote server interactively.</p>
<p>If you already have an SSH key set up, you’ll start to be asked to
enter a password every time you connect.</p>
<p>You can always connect to the Aalto VPN in advance to prevent this,
but there may be cases where this isn’t a practical solution.</p>
<p>If you do not have an SSH key set up, you should:</p>
<p>Follow <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/ssh/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>SSH</span></a> to generate an SSH key - we have
<em>heavily</em> revised this page to cover almost every common SSH
arrangement.</p>
<p>Place your SSH key on any common Aalto server (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kosh</span></code>, etc. -
<em>not</em> Triton since that doesn’t share home directories with the
public servers)</p>
<p>You could connect by VPN, and then use normal password to connect
and add the key.</p>
<p>You could use <a class="reference external" href="https://vdi.aalto.fi">https://vdi.aalto.fi</a> with a Linux computer to place
the key.</p>
<p>You could place the key while on an Aalto network (as usual, this
means <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eduroam</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aalto</span></code> <em>only</em> from an Aalto computer).</p>
<p>You could use another computer that’s already set up with an SSH
key to place the key.</p>
<p>The key will then be available on all common Aalto shell servers
(and other workstations), since they share the home directory.</p>
<p>Re-read <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/ssh/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>SSH</span></a>, in particular the
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/ssh/#ssh-agent" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>SSH key agent</span></a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/ssh/#proxyjump" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>ProxyJump</span></a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/ssh/#ssh-multiplex" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Multiplexing</span></a> sections, to see how to configure your
SSH to minimize the number of times you need to enter passwords.</p>
<p>This was needed for security as evidenced by recent history.
Password-only login is simply not feasible anymore (nor for some
time).  Removing passwords as an option is good security practice that
most organizations should adopt these days.</p>
<p>But why an ssh key <em>and</em> remote password instead of a properly
encrypted SSH key?  An SSH key requires something you have (the key)
and something you know (the password), doesn’t it?  And doesn’t
require sending a plaintext password to the remote server.  This was
decided by whoever is setting this up, probably partly due to the
fact that it is not possible to enforce passwords on SSH keys via
the server config.</p>
<p>In general (outside of Aalto), you should use SSH keys everywhere and
be wary of ever sending plaintext passwords to remote servers
(even in conjunction with an SSH key).  Security is important, and by
using SSH keys with local encryption of the key you are doing your part.</p>
<p>We apologize for the difficulty in getting work done and want to help
you as much as possible (though Science-IT was <em>not</em> the ones that
designed this or communicated it).</p>
<p>There are, unfortunately, some trivial workarounds that involve
putting your password in plain text on your computer to script things.
However, please note that writing passwords down (outside of password
managers) is bad security practise and against the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/password-guidelines">Aalto password guidelines</a>. It is better to

help design a better and more secure workflow, or ask <a class="reference external" href="https://www.aalto.fi/en/services/it-services">IT Services</a> and ask them to
consider other use cases.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Sometime in autumn of 2023 (e.g. October/November), we will do a major
update of Triton: updating the basic operating system, and thus almost
everything else.  There are big benefits to this: newer basic
operating system software, but also such a basic update affects almost
every user.  <strong>For a short time, this will make a lot of work for almost
every user.  This post gives advance warning and a chance of feedback
of how to make the update most usable.</strong></p>
<p>This post is just advance warning and things to prepare already.  All
actual instructions will come later.</p>
<p>We will update the basic operating system from CentOS 7 to something
else (Red Hat 9).  We’ve ordered all new management hardware
to make the backend more reliable and manageable.  Along with this
comes with an update of the software build system, which should allow
us to deploy software to our users even better.  We’ll also update our
configuration management system for more reproducibility.</p>
<p>We also hope to think about the usability of the new system: remove a
lot of old options and add in new, simpler ways of doing what people
need.</p>
<p>All data and storage will remain the same, so there <strong>is no big data
migration needed.</strong></p>
<p>The old and new clusters will be accessible at the same time (two
different login nodes), with the same filesystems mounted (same data
available) and some compute resources still available there, so that
people can slowly migrate.  But the old one won’t stay running too
long, to avoid long maintenance effort or splitting of the resources.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with big cluster updates like this is
<strong>reproducibility</strong>: does you work from a month ago still work in one
month?  If not, this is a big problem.  It’s even worse if there is a
much longer gap before you come back to it (paper revisions, anyone?).</p>
<p>You could say there are two things that can go wrong with a cluster upgrade or change:</p>
<p><strong>Specific software/code that needs to be compiled and installed:</strong>
Software needs re-compiling for new clusters or new cluster OS updates.</p>
<p><strong>Whole workflows:</strong> you need to make all the pieces work together.
Different paths and workflow managers may need updating.</p>
<p>What you can do:</p>
<p>Manage any messes you have earlier rather than later.  It’s better
if you slowly clean up over time, so you can focus on the
differences once the change happens.</p>
<p>Know what software you are using.  It’s easier for us to re-install something we
have already installed when someone can tell us the exact name and version
that they are using.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>This post describes the hiring process of Aalto RSE.  The goal is to
make hiring more equitable by providing the background information so
that everyone can apply successfully.  For those not applying to us,
it might still provide some valuable insight about how to market your
skills as a PhD making a sideways career move.  What’s said here may
not apply to every organization, but it might give you some things to
think about.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This page is a rough average description of the past, not
a promise to always do this in the future.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Aalto RSE</span></a> has usually hired people who have postdoc
experience and will transition to a more applied
software/data/computing oriented role (as opposed to being focused on
writing papers).  For many people, we are the first experience of job
applications post-degree and thus people have to learn how to present
their skills in a new, non-academic context.</p>
<p>One should start by reading about us - we have lots of information
publicly available about what we do and how we think.  This should be
understood in order to do the next steps well.</p>
<p>The cover letter is the most important thing we read, and the first
and most important filter.  It’s read before the CV.</p>
<p>At the level we are at, almost everyone’s CV and achievements are
effectively equivalent.  Does it matter who got the most fancy papers?
Who has the most awards?  The classes people took?  When most of a
person’s knowledge has come from self-study, probably not.  The cover
letter is the chance to interpret your skills in the context of the
job you are applying for.</p>
<p>When reading the cover letter, the first question we ask is “does this
person know what they are applying to and know why they think they are
a good fit?”  (It’s always interesting to get letters which clearly
don’t understand the job, but on the other hand it’s an easy filter.)
The first paragraph should answer this question and that the rest of
the letter will go into detail about why.  Start with the most
important information, don’t make it hard for us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, talk about interests and skills as relevant to the
organization.  Discuss special projects, including non-academic ones
or random things that you are interested in (this is especially true
for us, since we are the transition from academia to practical work).
Our job advertisement gives you some specific ideas that you can talk
about.  Anything specifically important to the job should be pointed
out here and not just left in the CV.</p>
<p>If you don’t exactly fit the stated job requirements: here is the
chance to explain it.  The job requirement has to say roughly what we
need (to not waste people’s time when applying, and because our hiring
decisions must be justifiable based on the requirements), but there
are many cases where someone with a different experience can
accomplish our actual goal (as said in the job ad or found in your
background research).  A person that can say this, that they are
adaptable, and will have a very good chance.</p>
<p>We have adopted some system of anonymous recruiting.  We request that
cover letters are submitted without identifying information (name,
signature, etc) so that one person gives them numbers, and a broader
group tries to take a non-biased look at them.  After this initial
impression, we bring in the rest of the application.  Don’t make
assumptions about what the reader will know about your background,
just say it.</p>
<p>The letter should be as short as possible to get the information
across.  One page is usually about the shortest we get, and a bit less
than two pages is typical.  But if it’s engaging, we’ll read as much
as you write.  Remember, most important information first, don’t make
us hunt for things.</p>
<p>Update 2024: Do you want to use AI to write your cover letter?  Please
think again.  Since LLMs became a thing, cover letters have become
harder to read, longer, and more generic-sounding.  It’s better to
write in your own voice and be shorter than rely on what AI gives
you.</p>
<p>The CV serves as non-anonymous reference information, but they are
hard to read and all look pretty similar.  To be honest, we don’t
worry that much about the format and contents here: get us basic
factual information in the most efficient way.  For our particular
jobs, non-academic skills such as software/data tools are more
important than scientific articles, etc.   Remember, we are busy
and have plenty of applications, make it easy to read.</p>
<p>Open Science isn’t just good for research, it’s good for you, too.  If
you can point to public repositories of work you have done, this is
very useful.  Things like Gitlab/Github profiles with activity and
your own projects, links to data you have released, etc.  They don’t
have to be perfect - something is better than nothing.  The best case
would be a few projects which are well-done (and you know it and point
them out to us), and plenty more stuff that may be of lower quality to
show you can get simple stuff done simply.  Not everyone is fortunate
to have a field where they can practice open science throughout their
career, but even publishing a project or two before they apply for a
job with us is very useful.</p>
<p>Despite what the previous section said, we do try to dig through
applications that seem on-topic but don’t say everything we are looking
for, to give them the most fair shot we can.</p>
<p>We always need to heavily filter the list down.  Some relevant
filtering includes:</p>
<p>Do they know what job they are applying for?  Can they connect their
skills to the job?</p>
<p>Have they touched on the main points in our job advertisement and
the linked “<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/become-a-rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Become a RSE</span></a>” page?</p>
<p>Are they interested in teaching, mentoring, and real collaborative
projects?  Do they know what kind of teaching and mentoring we do?</p>
<p>Is there enough knowledge about the research process?</p>
<p>Any relevant skills about this call’s particular topic (if there is
any)?</p>
<p>How do their skills and experience match what our team is currently
missing, regardless of the open call?</p>
<p>How similar has their previous work been to “research engineering”
(helping the research process) instead of only focusing on academic
promotion?</p>
<p>The recruitment team makes several passes over and we discuss how to
filter down.  We try to get a good variety of candidates.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is some initial recorded “video interviews”, which
provide some initial familiarity in both directions before the actual
interviews.  We know these are non-interactive and a recording isn’t a
conversation so this is harder than an interview, but we consider that
when watching them.  One shouldn’t worry too much about these, if we
do them.</p>
<p>Our actual interviews are not designed to be stressful.  We have some
prepared questions and go through them in a friendly manner.  You have
a chance to ask questions to use at the beginning and end (and any
other time too).  The questions are designed to hear about your
experiences and not trick or test you.</p>
<p>We don’t currently ask technical challenge questions.  The number of
things which you’d need to know is so broad, it’s more important that
you can learn things quickly.  Since we usually interview relatively
advanced people, we can instead look at existing projects they have
done and check references, without having to do a technical
challenge.  This may change depending on the type of candidates we are
interviewing, but just like the main interviews we are more interested
in how people think, rather than raw knowledge.</p>
<p>In the future, there might be more “meet the team” kind of events.</p>
<p>We want to respond to people as soon as possible, but there’s a simple
fact: we don’t want to tell anyone “no” until we are very sure we have
an acceptance (we don’t want to tell someone “no” and then hire them
later), and we have very many qualified candidates.  So there is often
an unfortunately long delay in hearing back.  We hope that everyone
knows within a month, though (and ideally ~2 weeks if all goes well).</p>
<p>We get a relatively large number of applications, with a lot of good
people.  So far (before 2023), we have been hiring at a relatively
high level - researchers with postdoc experience who have been some
sort of RSE-like experience with helping others with research (beyond
only focusing on making papers for themselves) and technology.
Don’t let this discourage you.  There are many qualified applications,
so if you don’t get selected, that doesn’t mean that you were
unqualified.  We look at everyone, regardless of their level, for
every position.  The fit to our particular job is more important that
anything else, so keep trying until you get the right fit - it’s just
a numbers game.</p>
<p>For reference, this is an older job application text, so that you can
see how the things above are integrated.  (to be updated with the 2023
version soon)</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p><a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/apps/whisper/">Whisper on Triton documentation</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">OpenAI Whisper</a> is a tool for
speech transcription.  It works well and has potential applications
in many different research and non-research use cases.  Using it isn’t
too hard - if you can install it and if you have a GPU.  Often, the
installing can become a big barrier, especially for “just testing”.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have a <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/">cluster</a> with
GPUs and a way to provide software for researchers.  We’ve made
Whisper available on the cluster as a <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/modules/">module</a>, so it’s trivial to
use it for any audio data you may have.  All one needs to do is:</p>
<p>It might look complicated, but all you need to do is copy and paste.
The first words request the resources, the middle specifies your file,
and the last are some standard options to make it do things like use
our pre-downloaded model files.  Yes - this still requires knowledge
of how to use a cluster in general, but once you’ve got that
knowledge, transcribing audio is trivial.  We have a <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/#tutorials">self-study
course</a> on cluster
usage, and users can always drop by and <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/">ask us for help</a>, for example our daily garage each
day.</p>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/apps/whisper/">Whisper on Triton documentation</a> for more
information on the use.</p>
<p>We are also preparing a way to do this through the cluster web
interface <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/usage/ood/">Open OnDemand</a>, which will remove
most of the need to know how a cluster works and make the tool even
more accessible to other communities.</p>
<p>We hope to make other tools available like this.</p>
<p>Whisper is just one of the latest tools, but you’ve probably noticed
that large language models are very popular these days.  There are, in
fact, some that can run locally on our own cluster, and our goal is to
deploy more of these so that they can be easily tested and used.  The
intention isn’t to make a replacement for existing LLM services, but
make internal for testing, research, and development use easier.</p>
<p>Local installs have various benefits, including lower cost (since we
already own the hardware), being able to ensure reproducibility
longer-term (since models are locally downloaded and preserved), and
being able to use without various registrations.  The downside is that
the most popular ones ones aren’t available for local use.</p>
<p><strong>Contact us if you need other models deployed, or if you have trouble
using what’s already out there.  We are still in an early phase, and
there will probably be some difficulties in availability,
accessibility, and reusability.</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/">Contact us early if you notice
anything that’s not right</a>.  We
both help installing things and <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/">help using them as a research
engineer partner</a>.</p>
<p>It’s clear that artificial intelligence and machine learning tools
will become more critical tools for other research.  The difficulty in
deploying and using them could become a barrier, and that is where
Aalto Scientific Computing comes in.  It’s our goal to make sure the
infrastructure that researchers need is ready and able to be used by
everyone, not just those with classic HPC experience.</p>
<p><em>Here we go over some implementation details, which may help others
who want to deploy similar things on their own clusters.  If you just
want to use things, you don’t need to read on.</em></p>
<p>We installed whisper in a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(software)">container</a>, so that all
dependencies are packaged together and things are portable.  The model
definitions themselves are <em>not</em> included in the container, but
mounted in.  We try to find options that allow one to specify the
model and model directory, so that the user can try out different
models without downloading each one.  The Lmod module file prints out
some help when loaded.</p>
<p>We’ve got two versions installed: normal Whisper, and
Whisper-diarization (which can identify speakers in the transcript).</p>
<p>Whisper and diarization both have multiple different
implementations. It’s bit of guesswork to try to see which one is the
easiest to get running / works the best (not about quality of
transcript, but easy of deployment in container and with local
models). This led to a change to another implementation of diarization
midway since the current one is more active in development and seems
overall slightly better. A lot of the work was fortunately
transferable to the new implementation.</p>
<p>There were the common issues with getting the right dependencies in a
container and getting the GPUs to work there.  This is pretty standard
by now.</p>
<p>Most implementations of whisper want to download models when running
it. This might make sense for general user, but doesn’t really make
sense on cluster. Depending on the implementation, getting it to use
local models is not always trivial. Since GPU execution of diarization
uses several models at once, there doesn’t seem to be a simple way to
have it use local models at all without changing the code. It also
required some sleuthing to find where exactly the models are
downloaded.  If a code uses Hugging Face, <a class="reference external" href="https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/main/en/package_reference/environment_variables">these environment variables</a>
can be useful.</p>
<p>Making a module that is both easy/practical to use for users without
also losing options is usually bit tricky: we want users to be able to
do anything, for “the right thing” to happen automatically, and not
build some opaque framework to make it happen.  Singularity-wrapper
fortunately helps quite a bit in doing lot of background stuff such as
binding directories, gpu flags, etc. cleanly without users having to
care about it, while still giving the option to run the container
straight through Apptainer/Singularity if finer control is necessary.</p>
<p>Testing if the containers work is somewhat annoying. Diarization in
particular saves a lot of cache files all over the place, which all
need to be purged when testing GPU running. Otherwise the GPU will
stay idle since everything it would do is already in cache.  This also
affects clean-up after users run the code.</p>
<p>A minor inconvenience for us (but possibly large for users) is that
the syntax for each Whisper CLI implementation tends to differ
slightly. This makes swapping between implementations slightly
annoying since you have to check every time what was the syntax for
flags.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>It’s time for our “kickstart course” - let’s talk about what that is,
why, and why you might want to attend.</p>
<p>The full name is “Introduction to scientific computing and HPC”
(high-performance computing), and it used to be called “HPC Kickstart”
and was taught without the first day, thus the short name “kickstart”
we still use.  Some years day 1 had a different name, but was still
taught together with days 2-3 as a package.</p>
<p>Our goal isn’t just to teach some skills, but to form a community
around scientific computing - with researchers who have a common
language to work together and help each other, supported by Aalto
Scientific Computing in the background.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2023/">Course page in 2023</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong> is not about high-performance computing things, but the
basic skills needed to do scientific computing: things like Linux
usage, data management, the types of tools available for different
problems.  For almost anyone doing any kind of programming/scientific
computing kind of work, regardless of background.  These kind of
skills aren’t taught in academic degree programs.  We teach these on
day 1 because otherwise, new researchers have to learn from each other
or re-invent.</p>
<p><strong>Days 2 and 3 are about high-performance computing, more precisely
basic cluster usage</strong> (with a focus of the basics).  This is focused
on the kinds of tools our community usually uses.</p>
<p>The topics are refined after many years of both teaching and support
of junior researchers.  Because of the way academic careers work (much
diversity of paths), these topics (even day 1) aren’t just for new
researchers but everyone can find something to learn or brush up on.</p>
<p>For the past years, we have been trying to keep up this yearly summer
schedule.  This usually happens the first full workweek:</p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> HR introductions, other formalities for new summer
workers - many departments seem to something like this.  This may
happen early than Monday of the kickstart week, since sometimes that
comes too late.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday afternoon:</strong> Kickstart course day 1, the general scientific
computing introduction.  Applicable to everyone doing scientific
computing.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday-Thursday afternoons:</strong> The HPC cluster usage part, which fewer
people will attend compared to Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> we don’t have scheduled programs on Fridays, but
sometimes there are communities who host advanced tutorials here
about what their local users need.  In 2023, there is at least an
advanced GPU course then.</p>
<p>We are aware that there is a scheduling conflict with the CS summer day
which is scheduled on the Tuesday of the 2023 HPC kickstart course.
We did contact every department in January/February, yet this was
still a surprise to us.  In past years, we have adjusted our schedule
to similar events, but this is not possible this year despite our best
efforts.</p>
<p>We will still try to support researchers as much as possible.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/&#64;aaltoscientificcomputing3454">Recordings of previous years are available on youtube</a>, and we
also release videos the same evening as the course precisely to
support everyone regardless of these conflicts.
Researchers can still join us for day 2 and 3 even if you did not join
day 1. However, please pay particular care to the instructions about
setting up the Triton connection in advance.</p>
<p>We hope that this blog post can explain our goals to a larger audience
so that we can reach even more people in the future, so that we can
expand to onboarding even more young researchers even more
systematically.  You can reach us at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:scip&#37;&#52;&#48;aalto&#46;fi">scip<span>&#64;</span>aalto<span>&#46;</span>fi</a>, and
each spring we reach out to the main departments to schedule each
summer’s course.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We recently had an internal “development day”, which is a our new name
for getting together to talk about longer term plans.  This is our
second “development day”.  Overall, it went well, and we think that we
are on an overall  good path.  There are three particular focus areas
for the future:</p>
<p><strong>Teaching:</strong> This was also a focus last time, and probably will
still be in the future.  We are overall happy with our decision
last time to focus less on many small/medium courses, and instead
focus on large, collaborative courses and then focused,
individualized support for advanced use cases.  Smaller courses
happen mainly when we see specific needs that can’t be filled other
ways (or we make them large, open, collaborative courses if there
is a broad need).</p>
<p><strong>Triton v3:</strong> The software/OS/management side of our cluster will
be almost completely reworked in the next year (we aren’t getting
rid of any hardware just for this).  This will take a fair amount
of our time, but is needed because existing systems are starting to
show their age.</p>
<p><strong>LUMI usage:</strong> LUMI is a flagship project of EuroHPC and provides
huge resources available to the same people that can use Triton.
Triton is still needed for ease of use of everyday projects, but we
should actively look for people who can benefit from it and help
them port to there.  Our recent evaluations lead to the conclusion
that our porting help is still needed there.</p>
<p>Teaching has long been one of the pillars of ASC’s support.  It’s
still needed, but the focus seems to be changing.  No longer is a room
with 10-20 (or ever 50) people considered a lot.  People seem both
more able and willing to find advanced material themselves, and more
in need of basic principles (git, Python for SciComp, etc).  Perhaps
this is also partly caused by the remote work period emphasizing how
all this material is available online anyway.  Our basic philosophy:</p>
<p><strong>Focus on large courses for new researchers</strong>, for example using
the <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/coderefinery-mooc/">CodeRefinery MOOC strategy</a>.
This reaches the most people, helps the beginners the most,
produces high-quality open source material for asynchronous
reference, and has good possibilities for co-teaching.
Example include <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.org">CodeRefinery</a>, our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2022-summer/">SciComp/HPC kickstart course</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/">Python for Scientific Computing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced, one-on-one, or small-group support</strong> via <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/">SciComp garage</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/">Research
Software Engineering service</a>.
This isn’t just for projects, but is also a useful service for
people learning from other advanced material in their work -
basically, we work as mentors.  One-on-one support is both more
rewarding for us and probably more useful to the user (relative to
time demands on both ends).  Anyway, advanced courses often aren’t
offered right when people need them, so we are left in this position
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>What about small/medium-sized courses, and advanced courses?</strong></p>
<p>The first two points above squeeze out medium-sized courses for
the most part, in our opinion.  By the time our audience is an
intermediate or advanced level, they seem to be able to figure
things out themselves + ask for help when needed - if they can
figure out what they need to do.  This point deserves further
study, though.  Instead, we point to other existing material.</p>
<p>We will make sure that we have good recommendations for advanced
self-study courses and generally chart out the resources so that our
users don’t have to.  This is mostly done by our <a class="reference external" href="https://hands-on.coderefinery.org">Hands-on Scientific
Computing</a> course.</p>
<p>In the past, we have supported community members to give courses on
topics of which they are experts.  Continue this as appropriate (see
the next point).</p>
<p>Continue the possibility of <strong>on-demand courses</strong> taught by us if
someone requests them, and other smaller courses if we see a strong
need.  Contact us!</p>
<p>Triton is our HPC cluster, and is notable for being a Ship of Theseus:
it’s continually upgraded while being the same cluster.  This has
resulted in the software running it getting a bit out of date.  This
software was originally developed as broader partnerships, and as
these partnerships have changed, we need to take more responsibility
for it ourselves.</p>
<p>Users shouldn’t see any major change from this, though part of it is
improving our (user) software installation tools, which should make
increased responsiveness to software installation requests.</p>
<p>As said above, Lumi is a significant resource, yet our users have not
come to us asking for our help in using it. Over the past six months, we
have found some Triton users who would benefit from it and helped
extend their workflows to work on LUMI.  We do this by first testing
some applications ourselves, then looking at Triton usage for large
users and reaching out directly.</p>
<p>Currently our focus is on GPU-intensive applications, which is made
more interesting because LUMI has AMD GPUs.  We’ve gotten local AMD
GPUs for our own testing and in general are well prepared to support
this.</p>
<p>While LUMI is a HPC system and has a typical HPC system interface, it
serves so many different users that the software stack is very
limited, so that most users need to install their own software and
figure out how to run it on AMD GPUs.  This is why we recommend most users
access LUMI through us (we’re paid to save you time, after all), though
of course anyone interested can use it directly.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We have stickers (and patches!) to support Aalto Scientific Computing.
(You can get them from our IT offices in CS, NBE, and Physics) But why
invest in this?  Well, it’s fun, but there should be a deeper reason.</p>
<p>While our main goal is to maintain Aalto University Triton HPC cluster,
provide courses and direct support to researchers, we cannot scale to
solve all problems and make the best decisions without a community: you!
Thus, our new promotional material is designed so that the members of our
community can show their support for scientific computing at Aalto
University.  We hope that by providing a way for the community to show
this interest, people can find - and support - each other better.</p>
<p>We have the typical hexagonal stickers, which you can use on all the typical
sticker things.</p>
<p>We also have patches, for those who are interested - in Finland they
are a big thing on [student
overalls](<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_boilersuit">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_boilersuit</a>), but you
could also sew them on your backpack or purse. Please send us pictures to
inspire us all! (some have Velcro backing for that kind)
of attachment, ask us for that style.</p>
<p>You may notice that for the patches some have a black background and
some have a white background.  <strong>Black-background means “Ask me
anything about the tools of scientific computing, I am happy to
help or at least point you the right direction (as much as I can)!”</strong></p>
<p>Here’s our idea:</p>
<p>Anyone may take the white background ones</p>
<p>Black background is for:</p>
<p>Aalto Scientific Computing team staff</p>
<p>Volunteers at our events (for example helpers at our workshops)</p>
<p><strong>Anyone who is interested in using their time to help others in
scientific computing (regardless of their skills)</strong></p>
<p>(clever people will notice that the first two are included in the
third, and actually anyone can be the third if they want).</p>
<p>The idea is that we, and our community, can’t work alone.  Everyone
needs to support each other in order to work at the level we want.
The in-group experts are an undervalued resource in this, often not
getting the credit or recognition they deserve in supporting
everyone.  This is our small method of recognizing those supporters,
and we hope that in the future we support them ever more - both
career-wise and supporting them in supporting others.</p>
<p>Yes, we should have gotten black-background stickers.  We’ll do that
next time…</p>
