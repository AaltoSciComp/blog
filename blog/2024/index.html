    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>What is a Research Software Engineer (RSE)?  Too many things to
define, you can find these definitions elsewhere.  Maybe the question
you would like to know is <strong>How do I get value from Research Engineers
like Aalto Scientific Computing does?</strong> - that’s what we’ll try to
answer here.  Through that, we may learn a functional definition.</p>
<p>This page is written from the perspective of <em>computational science</em> -
similar messages may apply to other fields.  Note that computing and
AI is in every field now.</p>
<p>When someone wants Research Engineers, it’s probably because they see
something that is missing in the current academic system.  Thus, to
understand what we want, we need to understand the system.  Below is
rkdarst’s current mental model:</p>
<p><strong>Academics</strong> are who we usually consider researchers.  They do
research, and are promoted based on articles published and citations
received from other academics.  Citations from academics tend to
focus on innovation and novelness, so that’s what decides career
paths.</p>
<p><strong>Research Engineers (REs)</strong> focus on the practice and “structural
integrity” of the research: the tools, the reproducibility, and
more.  They are more concerned with the work being done well, than
pure novelness and citations. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>0<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are a subset of Research
Engineers, and I feel that the “software” is the least significant
part there.  Software is important, but so is data, computing,
reproducibility, etc.</p>
<p>Particular examples of things that Research Engineers are good at
include: Reproduciblity, maintaining software and data across academic
generations, Open Science, programming, using large computer
clusters, data security, and research ethics processes.</p>
<p><strong>Researchers</strong>, in my mind, cover both of the above (and more).
Industrial research teams would have both of the above and possibly
even more different roles all working together on their problems.
In universities, we tend to only consider the academics to
researchers.</p>
<p>So what’s a Research Engineer?  To me, it’s defined mostly in terms of
what is missing from the typical academic career path (of
undergraduate → junior researcher → senior researcher).  At all
levels, I’ve seen research engineering under-valued and under-taught
(not necessarily because it’s not wanted, but because it’s not novel
science and there’s no time).  Senior researchers (group leaders)
often see the value, but don’t have the time (or sometimes ability) to
train and supervise research engineers well.</p>
<p>Years before Aalto RSE started (~2017-2018), I saw a need for more
basic skills (for example: version control to manage code) and worked
to promote them in undergraduate programs.  This basically didn’t
work, because they were seen as not scientific thus not something to
be taught in academic courses (and if they were thought, the courses
would be full of people looking for easy ECTS).  While there certainly
are study programs in software and software engineering, these are
their own thing, and not part of data science, or other fields that
need computation.  Software engineering programs also aren’t adapted
for the unpredictibility of research.</p>
<p>This was the prompting to start Aalto Research Software Engineers - if
we can’t teach people skills in study programs, we have to support
them when they become researchers (and teach it via practical
mentoring).  This has worked out very well, as you can see by our
rapid expansion and heavy usage.</p>
<p>Aalto RSE is essentially the collaborator our research groups need to
do their top-level work.  This system works very well, but are there
other options?</p>
<p>The above leads to various ideas.  Take your pick for what angle
you want to approach the problem:</p>
<p>Better RE teaching in undergraduate programs:</p>
<p>As part of existing programs (is there time to teach this?  Is
there desire?  On the other hand, RE skills are great for
employment prospects)</p>
<p>As dedicated majors? (Some people are trying to make dedicated RSE
study programs at different universities, and there is a value
there.  But if you ask me the best value is learning RE along with
academic research in a different field)</p>
<p>Better RE teaching in graduate programs:</p>
<p>Many of the same things as above apply here, mainly the lack of
time, and the necessity to spend time on novel research, not
learning existing best practices.</p>
<p>Nurture REs within existing research groups:</p>
<p>Nothing stops group leaders from hiring students and postdocs who
have chosen to focus on research engineering.  This often happens
when supervisors hire technical postdocs to manage the RE side of
things.  (The question is: can they be supervised and mentored
well by academic supervisors, if they need to be home-grown?)</p>
<p>If group leaders hire good candidates, Aalto RSE can help mentor
them.  See the companion blog post <a class="reference internal" href="../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">RSE work rotations</span></a>
for one idea.</p>
<p>Recruit REs as professor-level group leaders” similar to how senior
academics are recruited:</p>
<p>These people would focus on collaborating with others to make
projects possible.</p>
<p>The university systems don’t seem set up to value these people,
thus they don’t appear among the ranks.  They could appear if they
spent their careers chasing academic citations, but then would
they be able to spend enough time on research engineering?</p>
<p>I think this is what some people mean when they say they want a
RSE career path: a way to recruit senior academics who lead
research engineering groups.  I think the idea is good but it’s
not how universities are set up, so it’s a long way off.  The
values systems may not even match up.</p>
<p>Create parallel structures that support research engineering</p>
<p>That is what Aalto RSE has done.  We are researchers, but we make
new research possible by collaborating with academics, instead of
trying to publish by ourselves.  We are part of the services of
the School of Science.</p>
<p>We also take it upon ourselves to do teaching and mentoring via
co-working for all types of researchers (aspiring academic or
research engineer).  We can fill in the technical mentoring that’s
missing by many supervisors.</p>
<p>You can read about <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/history/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">our history</span></a> in
more detail.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many people interested in gaining research engineering
competence for their organization.  You need to develop an environment
where they fill in the gaps you need.</p>
<p>Junior academics: encourage them to explore their technical skills.
Show that there is value in this, even if it reduces the number of
publications.  Encourage them to get training (for example the Aalto
RSE training).  Give them time, encouragement, and career prospects
to reach beyond the focus on papers.</p>
<p>Other support staff at universities and other organizations: don’t
view them as limited-purpose supporters of an {infrastructure,
service, process}.  View them as supporters of research: let them
holistically support research projects from many angles at once,
rather than only in narrow silos with strict project reporting
requirements.</p>
<p>You can hire dedicated staff to be REs, but it’s important that they
are integrated into the local research environment.  Most of our
hires have been local staff who have grown into a new role, and I
think this is how it should be.</p>
<p>Any of the above, especially the first two, require time being made
available for RE work and a clear vision and network.  Aalto RSE (with
the help of others in Finland) is planning on making a networking and
onboarding program for new research engineers who wish to adopt this
vision.</p>
<p>If you read this far, you probably see the value in research engineers
and want them yourself.  Just hiring someone, or changing someone’s
job to “RSE”, won’t magically solve the problem you need.  It’s a
whole mindset shift towards a multi-disciplinary research team.</p>
<p>What’s the right level of research engineers, permanent and
experienced or junior and learning?  Probably a bit of both.</p>
<p>I know that “Research Engineer” is a job title that can have
other definitions.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>We occasionally get some questions: how busy is the cluster?  How
long do I have to wait?  Is there some dashboard that can tell me?</p>
<p>The answer is, unfortunately, not so easy.  <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Our cluster</span></a> uses dynamic scheduling with a fairshare algorithm.
All users have a fairshare priority, which decreases the more you have
recently run.  Jobs are ranked by priority (including fairshare plus
other factors), and scheduled in that order.  If there are
unschedulable holes between those jobs, it can take a job with a lower
priority and fill them in (“backfilling”).  So that gives us:</p>
<p>A small-enough job with a low priority might still be scheduled
soon.</p>
<p>A higher priority user could submit something while you are waiting,
and increase your wait time.</p>
<p>An existing job could end early, making other wait times shorter.</p>
<p>An existing job could end early, allowing some other higher priority
jobs to run sooner, making backfilled jobs run later.</p>
<p>In short: there is no way to give an estimate of the wait time, in the
way people want.  We’ve tried but haven’t find a way to answer the
question well.</p>
<p>What can we know?</p>
<p>You can compare your fairshare factor with other users.  If you run
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sshare</span></code> you can see the fairshare (higher means higher priority).
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sprio</span></code> shows relatively priority for all jobs (here, the raw values
are multiplied by some factor and added).  On Triton (the new install
since 2024 may), they mean the following:</p>
<p>at 7 days) (zero when first submitted, increasing to 10000 at 7
days old)</p>
<p>The fairshare factor is “1e7 × FairShare priority from sshare”</p>
<p>The FairShare value is computed based on the raw usage value: at
each level of the share tree, it divides it up among the users so
that those who have run less have a higher priority.</p>
<p>The usage value decays with a two-week half life.</p>
<p>The others are mostly constant.</p>
<p>Still: this is all very abstract and what others submit has more
effect than your priority.  The only thing you can control is using
less resources.</p>
<p>This is quite cluster dependent so we’d recommend asking for help for
how your own cluster is setup.</p>
<p>This may be your real question. There are two main things:</p>
<p>Use less resources.  <strong>Make sure you don’t over-request more than
you need (CPU, memory, GPUs)</strong> - this will affect your future
fairshare less. Of course, use everything you need, “saving for
later” doesn’t give you more resources than you save now.</p>
<p>Request less resources per job.  This will let you be backfilled
into the scheduling holes (see below).</p>
<p>In this case, if there is a slot for you, you are scheduled very soon.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">srun</span> <span class="pre">--test</span> <span class="pre">[RESOURCE_REQUESTS]</span></code> might give you some hint about
when a job would be scheduled - it basically tries to schedule an
empty job and reports the currently estimated start time. (It uses a
JobID though so don’t run it in a loop)</p>
<p>In this case, nothing can be said since the queue is always being
re-shuffled.  In the long-run, you get a fair share of resources.  If
you haven’t used much lately, you have more now.  Your wait time
depends more on what other users submit (and their priorities) than
what you submit - and this is always changing.  You can tell something
about how soon you’d be scheduled by looking at your priority relative
to other users.  Make your jobs as small and efficient as possible to
fit in between the holes of other jobs and get scheduled as soon as
possible.  If you can break one big job into smaller pieces (less
time, less CPU, less memory) that depend on each other, then you can
better fit in between all of the big jobs.  See the <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/TTT4HPC_resource_management/scheduling/">Tetris metaphor
here in TTT4HPC</a></p>
<p>If your need is “run stuff quickly for testing”, make sure the jobs
are as short as possible.  Hopefully, your cluster staff about
development or debugging partitions that may be of use, because that’s
the solution for quick tests.</p>
<p>This description was in an old version of our docs but has since been
removed.  The exact values are out of date.  It’s included here for
detailed reference anyway:</p>
<p>Triton queues are not first-in first-out, but “fairshare”.  This means
that every person has a priority.  The more you run the lower your
user priority.  As time passes, your user priority increases again.
The longer a job waits in the queue, the higher its job priority goes.
So, in the long run (if everyone is submitting an never-ending stream
of jobs), everyone will get exactly their share.</p>
<p>Once there are priorities, then: jobs are scheduled in order of
priority, then any gaps are backfilled with any smaller jobs that can
fit in.  So small jobs usually get scheduled fast regardless.</p>
<p><em>Warning: from this point on, we get more and more technical, if you
really want to know the details.  Summary at the end.</em></p>
<p>What’s a share?  Currently shares are based on department and their
respective funding of Triton (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sshare</span></code>).  It used to be that
departments had a share, and then each member had a share of that
department.  But for complex reasons we have changed it so that it’s
flat: so that each person has a share, and the shares of everyone in a
department corresponds to that department’s share.  When you are below
your share (relative to everyone else), you have higher priority, and
vice versa.</p>
<p>Your priority goes down via the “job billing”: roughly time×power.
CPUs are billed at 1/s (but older, less powerful CPUs cost less!).
Memory costs .2/GB/s.  But: you only get billed for the max of memory
or CPU. So if you use one CPU and all the memory (so that no one else
can run on it), you get billed for all memory but no CPU.  Same for
all CPUs and little memory.  This encourages balanced use.  (this also
applies to GPUs).</p>
<p>GPUs also have a billing weight, currently tens of times higher than a
CPU billing weight for the newest GPUs.  (In general all of these can
change, for the latest info see search <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BillingWeights</span></code> in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/slurm/slurm.conf</span></code>).</p>
<p>If you submit a long job but it ends early, you are only billed for
the actual time you use (but the longer job might take longer to start
at the beginning).  Memory is always billed for the full reservation
even if you use less, since it isn’t shared.</p>
<p>The “user priority” is actually just a record how much you have
consumed lately (the billing numbers above).  This number goes down
with a half-life decay of 2 weeks.  Your personal priority your share
compared to that, so we get the effect described above: the more you
(or your department) runs lately, the lower your priority.</p>
<p>If you want your stuff to run faster, the best way is to more
accurately specify your time (may make that job can find a place
sooner) and memory (avoids needlessly wasting your priority).</p>
<p>While your job is pending in the queue SLURM checks those metrics
regularly and recalculates job priority constantly.  If you are
interested in details, take a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html">multifactor priority plugin</a> page (general
info) and <a class="reference external" href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor3.html">depth-oblivious fair-share factor</a> for what we
use specifically (warning: very in depth page).  On Triton, you can
always see the latest billing weights in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/slurm/slurm.conf</span></code></p>
<p>Numerically, job priorities range from 0 to 2^32-1.  Higher is
sooner to run, but really the number doesn’t mean much itself.</p>
<p>These commands can show you information about your user and job
priorities:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">s</span></code></p>
<p>list of jobs per user with their current priorities</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">full</span></code></p>
<p>as above but almost all of the job parameters are listed</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">shares</span></code></p>
<p>displays usage (RawUsage) and current FairShare weights (FairShare, higher is better) values for all users</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sshare</span></code></p>
<p>Raw data of the above</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sprio</span></code></p>
<p>Raw priority of queued jobs</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">slurm</span> <span class="pre">j</span> <span class="pre">&lt;jobid&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>shows <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;jobid&gt;</span></code> detailed info including priority, requested nodes etc.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Just select the resources you think you need, and Slurm
tries to balance things out so everyone gets their share.  The best
way to maintain high priority is to use resources efficiently so you
don’t need to over-request.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Let’s say you want to start a Research (Software) Engineer team in
your own unit.  How do you set your new hires off on the right
path?  A proposal is outlined below.</p>
<p>This is a companion post to <a class="reference internal" href="../../2024/rse-collaboration/"><span class="doc">Future RSE collaboration in Finland</span></a>.</p>
<p>You need to find the right person to hire for the role.  Most likely,
this means someone with the skills you need but the mindset to
transition from their own work to making other work possible.  You can
find hiring resources on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">the Aalto RSE page</span></a> and some brief thoughts in the companion post
<a class="reference internal" href="../../2024/rse-collaboration/"><span class="doc">Future RSE collaboration in Finland</span></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have hired someone.  What’s next?</p>
<p>This proposal is much easier for someone inside of Aalto University
than outside, but possibly could be negotiated for others.</p>
<p>Your new hire works as part of the existing School of Science RSE
team initially, perhaps ~1 year.</p>
<p>The hire is paid, organizationally supervised in, and sits in your
own unit.  It is absolutely critical that they maintain close
connections to your own unit, the membership in our team is only
virtual.  (Our team is remote-first, so this is easy).</p>
<p>They focus on projects from your own unit, but as part of our daily
flow.  This could mean asking your audience to join our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a> for help and requesting that new big
projects come via our project management systems.</p>
<p>Your new hire will learn all about how we work.</p>
<p>Your new hire will experience a tremendous diversity of projects and
work with experts on them.</p>
<p>After the initial ~1 year period, we sit down and decide what is
next.  Does your new hire stay working as part of our team (with a
greater focus on your own unit’s projects)?  Or do they split off
and start doing their own thing in your unit?  Or some combination?</p>
<p>This gives you the most important part of our onboarding and training.
There is no better way to develop the right mindset.  If we split
later, your staff will know who to ask for harder problems that come
up later.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>The Aalto University School of Science has a successful
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Research Software Engineering service</span></a>
serving the whole university.  This service has proven its value and
there are an increasing number of questions of how others can form
their own teams in Finland and work together.  This post gives some
thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>This page is the opinion of the author and not Aalto itself.  It’s not
an open offer for collaboration.  The author is happy to help with any
questions you may have (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">first.last&#64;aalto.fi</span></code> or various chat
systems).</p>
<p>Universities have academics: the traditional core, making ideas and
new results.  Much research, even not “computer science”, needs
computational tools.  However, the skills needed even for basic
computation can be so complex that not all academics can master it to
do cutting-edge research.  A Research (Software) Engineer (RSE) can
bridge that gap: academics focus on their primary work, and the RSE
makes the computing seamless.</p>
<p>For more info, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Aalto RSE site</span></a>.
This is not that different from research engineers supporting complex
physical equipment.</p>
<p>We’ve found there are plenty of qualified people to hire.  The harder
part is mentoring them to transition from a researcher (focused on
single projects with emphasis on own publications) to supporter
(supporting a wide variety of people with respect and compassion).
This transition needs active mentoring.</p>
<p>See the companion post about
<a class="reference internal" href="../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">work rotations for RSE mentoring</span></a> -
if you are in Aalto University then start there.</p>
<p>You should decide if you want (a) wide-ranging support which may
include helping with basics or (b) specialist support for a
limited audience.  I would argue that our most important impact is
(a): this has gotten us the most benefit overall, and a steady stream
of more advanced projects as work advances.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want your own RSE team at your own organization.  How
can you and Aalto RSE work together?</p>
<p>Even without joint funding, some of us Aalto people would be happy to
talk and give some advice, and be part of a broader general network.
For example:</p>
<p>How our team works, what makes it work, advice for your team</p>
<p>Joint RSE seminars to build skills, for example as part of
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/tech/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>FCCI Tech (aka the SciComp Tech series)</span></a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://nordic-rse.org/events/seminar-series/">Nordic-RSE seminar series</a>, or something new.
Both of these are good for professional development and community.</p>
<p>All the advice and practices on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">the Aalto RSE site</span></a>.</p>
<p>Professional networking and so on.</p>
<p>However, without funding, Aalto needs to focus on its own work.</p>
<p>With joint funding, it might be possible to make a collaboration.</p>
<p>Any higher level collaboration needs to be discussed with management.
Assuming these discussions go well, we might join a collaboration
together so that we can actually share projects between the team.
There should always be a strong local presence, because
that gets the best value.  This opens more possibilities.</p>
<p>The more experienced or larger teams could provide:</p>
<p>Mentoring possibilities for new research engineers and their teams
(see <a class="reference internal" href="../../2024/rse-work-rotations/"><span class="doc">RSE work rotations</span></a>).</p>
<p>A base for professional networking.</p>
<p>A larger base of knowledge, for more advice and help with specialist
problems.  A very important part of our team is that for almost any
problem, someone has seen it and can solve it quickly.  Then we
train others to solve it.</p>
<p>Joint support sessions such as our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a>,
which allowed a wider support base for problems, covering the
previous point.</p>
<p>The newer or smaller teams could provide:</p>
<p>Funding via some joint project.</p>
<p>More staff around to help fill in the gaps when needed (these staff
also get training in these projects they experience).</p>
<p>Specialty domain knowledge (both for support of academics and for
professional development).</p>
<p>A collaboration with larger funding could have a joint project flow:
there is one place to submit new projects requests, and the right
people in any organization will work on them.</p>
<p>We would welcome observers in our support sessions, especially from
other staff at Aalto.  The <a class="reference external" href="https://nordic-rse.org/about/getinvolved/">Nordic-RSE chat</a> is also a good way to
ask questions and see what we are up to for those outside Aalto
University.</p>
<p>We know of various opportunities being considered for national
(Finland) or international RSE collaborations.  The above are some
basic thoughts, but any model would be tailored to the actual funding
and partners.  There is definitely a benefit to starting off
together.</p>

<p>It has the same name, and importantly the same user accounts and data,
but all the software and operating system is changed.  In particular:</p>
<p>All software modules are different</p>
<p>Any software which has been complied will need to be re-compiled.</p>
<p>Triton’s previous operating system was released in 2014.  Security
support runs out at the end of 2024 May, and it <em>has</em> to be updated.
Stability is good for research, so we try to reduce the number of
changes (compare)</p>
<p>We realize that a change is very disruptive and painful, especially
since the expectation is that Triton never changes.  But an old
operating system makes problem for users too, and they have gotten
more and more over the years.</p>
<p>Most of the transition for different types of software is described in

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>When updating Triton, many users will get a message like this (or
similar things if you use other SSH clients like PuTTY):</p>
<p>SSH (Secure SHell) is made to be secure, and that means one it
verifies the server you are connecting <strong>to</strong> via its <strong>ssh host
key</strong>.  The representation of this key is the <strong>fingerprint</strong>, like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SHA256:OqCehC2lbHdl8mYGI/G9vlxTwew3H3KrvxKDkwIQy9Y</span></code>.  This means
that the NSA or someone can’t intercept the connecting and get your
password by pretending to be Triton.  This is a good thing.</p>
<p>OpenSSH (the command line program on Linux, MacOS, Windows) saves
these connection IDs (fingerprints) in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts</span></code>.  Other programs may store the keys
somewhere else.</p>
<p>The warning looks scary but the first thing to ask is “should the
server I am connecting to have changed?”.  If you have been directed
to this blog post, then probably yes, it has.  You should <em>always</em>
think if the fingerprint should change, and if there is no reason for
them to have changed, contact your administrators.  You can usually
verify the keys online, for example
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/usage/ssh-fingerprints/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Triton ssh key fingerprints</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you are on command line OpenSSH (Linux), it will propose a command
that will remove the old host key:</p>
<p>For other programs, follow whatever prompts it might give to replace
the host key fingerprint.</p>
<p>When you get a “The authenticity of host ‘triton.aalto.fi’ can’t be
established”, verify the SSH key fingerprints that are presented, then
click “yes” to permanently save them (until they change next, they can
always be updated).  The fingerprints for Triton v3 are:</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>The “Research Software Engineer” service provides technical
collaborators for researchers to complement their scientific
knowledge.  <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Read about Aalto RSE here</span></a>.
The idea of this service was that it would be available to everyone,
but some projects who made extensive use would fund it themselves.</p>
<p>If you are a group leader reading this, Aalto RSE can help you release
research code, debug it, make it reusable, rescue old code from former
members and make it usable again, make it run on our cluster or CSC’s
clusters, manage data, prepare data for easy use, and so on.  If it’s
not long (less than a month), our work is free, if it’s more than a
month, the below applies.</p>
<p>When we started, we hoped for around 50% project funding.  The idea
was that a lot of the funding for the service would come from the
research projects themselves.  This hasn’t really worked out so well,
because a) we accomplish the vast majority of our projects quickly, in
less than a few weeks, and b) finance would understandably not like to
deal with small transactions for small amounts of time.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that we basically have received only a small amount of the
project funding we would have wanted.  On the other hand, this also
means we have supported a far wider variety of projects than we would
have otherwise.  It also means we are better accomplishing our other
goal: tactical support right where and when it’s needed most, with the
least amount of administrative overhead.  This actually better matches
our mission of helping the researchers who need us most.</p>
<p>For any <strong>long projects</strong> (more than a month or so), we still follow
do our original plan: we can receive funding from grants (or basic
funding) to do long-term projects.  This is usually 40-80% of a RSE’s
time, spread out over more than a month (and it can also be bursty:
lots of work at some times, waiting for the next task at other times).
We have done this for projects, and we know we can do it in the
future.</p>
<p>But there’s another thing that has worked well: <strong>retainer</strong>-type
funding instead of project-based funding.  You have extra funding that
needs to be used?  You know your group needs support but you can’t
name a single specific project to use all the time?  Hire RSEs on
long-term retainers and we’re there for you as needed.  <strong>You will
always get priority for all the quick questions you have</strong> (in
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a> or otherwise), and you get the highest
priority for your medium projects, we can attend your other group
meetings, and so on.  As your team wants, we’ll make high-impact
improvements here and there.  This could be (for example) anywhere
from 10-40% time over a long period.</p>
<p>We <em>have</em> worked out how to do both one-off projects and retainers
with Finance.  As for as external funders are concerned, our staff
count as researchers, so we can use any funding you might have.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you have a project or want us on retainer, let us
know:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Research Software Engineers</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/how-we-work/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Starting a project with us</span></a>.</p>
<p>This is a valid questions.  Compared to many RSE groups, we seem to be
focusing on many small questions for a broad audience that knows a lot
about the problems they need to solve.  Thus, we can come in to
something already set up well, provide help, and mostly back off and
be available for maintenance long-term.  The units that fund us
(schools, departments) have been happy with this, so we’ve kept it up.
On the other hand, we are pretty fast.  There have been projects where
a summer worker was going to be hired, that we could end up doing
(learning the framework + all the main tasks) in two weeks.  The way
we work together as a team also makes things quite fast.  Thus, a
project has to be quite deep in order to exceed a month of work.</p>

    <p class="ablog-post-excerpt"><p>Our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2023/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">kickstart course</span></a> came and
went with very few problems.  This post summarizes our general
thoughts on the course and its format.</p>
<p>If you want to join the course next year (as an attendee, or as an
organization who will send your learners to us (and maybe co-teach)
<a class="reference external" href="https://fosstodon.org/&#64;SciCompAalto">follow us on Mastodon</a>.  This
is the third year we’ve done the livestream format, and it’s not
likely to stop anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>This was originally written in June 2023 but publication was
forgotten until 2024.</em></p>
<p>The course has run since around 2015 or so.  Until mid 2020, it was always
in-person only.  Until (and including) 2022, it ran twice a year,
January and June, but now it runs only in June (increased availability
of videos + the material compensates).  It runs in June so that it
aligns with new summer research interns starting.  Until around 2020,
it was mostly about using the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">HPC cluster at Aalto
University</span></a>, but since then there has been more
emphasis on day 1 covering generic skills needed for scientific
computing and the big picture of things.</p>
<p>Our general feedback remains quite positive.  Our streaming +
coteaching + collaborative notes format is still well received, and
there seems to be little reason to go back for courses of smaller
scale.  Instead of just lectures, written material (tutorials in info
on scicomp.aalto.fi) + livestream + videos is a good combination.</p>
<p>There is never enough time - not much else to say.  Each year there is
a different trade-off between how much we cover and how brief we are.
(There are always people who say we should go more in-depth, and some
who say we go too much in-depth.  Such is life.)</p>
<p>Repetition is good, but not when it’s a sign that we can’t stop
talking and keep saying the same thing over and over.  The best
lessons seemed to be the ones that were taught most quickly, since it
has a high density of new information.  We should strive to make more
lessons faster, and leave details to the reading.</p>
<p>Because the teachers also do support, for anything difficult, we can
easily tell learners: “Do what you can, come by our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/#garage" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-ref">SciComp garage</span></a> to ask for help with anything
else.  This overall reduces the demands from teaching: a person
doesn’t have to know everything, but know enough to get started and to
know when they may need more help for more advanced tools.  This
really is good for both of us.</p>
<p>As usual, we expected our learners to read our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/">shell crash course</a> in advance.  We also had
a new tutorial on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/cluster-shell/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">using the cluster from the shell</span></a>.  This helped some, but it was still a
problem.</p>
<p>Reflection: this will always be a problem in any course that has a
wide enough audience.  We should accept and provide positive support
for those not ready, and not try to exclude them.  It’s OK to see a
course and then strive to get the prerequisites later.</p>
<p>Internally, we had this thought of dividing the course in two: a basic
part at the start of the summer, and an advanced part at the end of
the summer -
since brand new researchers may have trouble understanding
everything.  On the other hand, the fact we have videos means that
people can come back and review the material when they are ready.  So
in some sense, learners can divide the course however they would like
by stopping when they think it’s no longer necessary and coming back.
This could be mentioned more explicitly in our introductions.</p>
<p>Attendance goes down day-by-day.  This is definitely OK - it doesn’t
hurt anyone.  It’s expected that day 1 was suitable for the most
people (even those not doing HPC work), and then the course topics got
continually more specific as we went further and further.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this is even be expected and encouraged - better
to have someone attend day 1, than not.</p>
<p>Our exercises are quite basic overall, but we got few complains about
this.  Basic exercises are better than something too advanced or
realistic, that requires many things to come together.</p>
<p>This year, we tried to have a complete solution for every exercise
(script and/or commands), even if it’s directly said above in the
lesson.  This seemed to be good, since for people very short of time,
they still have some chance to copy and paste and do the exercises.
For those passively following, they can at least see what would have
been done.</p>
<p>Day 3 / end of course feedback positive feedback (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code> is the way a
person votes for/agrees with that option:</p>
<p>it’s great that the material is so easily accessible also after the
course to go through things in my own pace again oo</p>
<p>Really good format with the streaming and the shared document for
questions. ooooo</p>
<p>The cat kept me focused in the lecture</p>
<p>Live interaction with the instructes were very helpful and exercises were nice</p>
<p>I really appreaciate the instructors took the time to explain the
jargons, instead of just letting them fly around. o</p>
<p>The fact that the instructors were really nice contributed to the
good course experience. Thanks for that! o</p>
<p>(day 1) After studying remotely for 1,5 year and having lots of
online classes, I highly appreciate the amazing audio quality
here. Many thanks for that!</p>
<p>(day 1) The framework is better than any other workshop I’ve ever
attended - in terms of interaction and audio quality. HackMD is
great.</p>
<p>(day 1) The (twitch) vertical screen thing is genius and should be
used in way more (online) lectures o</p>
<p>Most common negative feedback: not enough time! In fact, that’s
almost only thing to improve. Except we can’t, so I think we win
pretty well. And videos/material allows follow-up.</p>
