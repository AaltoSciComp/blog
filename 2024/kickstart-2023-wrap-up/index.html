<h1>Kickstart 2023 wrap-up and thoughts for the future<a class="headerlink" href="#kickstart-2023-wrap-up-and-thoughts-for-the-future" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/kickstart-2023/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">kickstart course</span></a> came and
went with very few problems.  This post summarizes our general
thoughts on the course and its format.</p>
<p>If you want to join the course next year (as an attendee, or as an
organization who will send your learners to us (and maybe co-teach)
<a class="reference external" href="https://fosstodon.org/&#64;SciCompAalto">follow us on Mastodon</a>.  This
is the third year we’ve done the livestream format, and it’s not
likely to stop anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>This was originally written in June 2023 but publication was
forgotten until 2024.</em></p>
<section id="history-of-the-course">
<h2>History of the course<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-the-course" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The course has run since around 2015 or so.  Until mid 2020, it was always
in-person only.  Until (and including) 2022, it ran twice a year,
January and June, but now it runs only in June (increased availability
of videos + the material compensates).  It runs in June so that it
aligns with new summer research interns starting.  Until around 2020,
it was mostly about using the <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">HPC cluster at Aalto
University</span></a>, but since then there has been more
emphasis on day 1 covering generic skills needed for scientific
computing and the big picture of things.</p>
</section>
<section id="general-feedback">
<h2>General feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#general-feedback" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Our general feedback remains quite positive.  Our streaming +
coteaching + collaborative notes format is still well received, and
there seems to be little reason to go back for courses of smaller
scale.  Instead of just lectures, written material (tutorials in info
on scicomp.aalto.fi) + livestream + videos is a good combination.</p>
</section>
<section id="not-enough-time">
<h2>Not enough time<a class="headerlink" href="#not-enough-time" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There is never enough time - not much else to say.  Each year there is
a different trade-off between how much we cover and how brief we are.
(There are always people who say we should go more in-depth, and some
who say we go too much in-depth.  Such is life.)</p>
</section>
<section id="reduce-repetition">
<h2>Reduce repetition<a class="headerlink" href="#reduce-repetition" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Repetition is good, but not when it’s a sign that we can’t stop
talking and keep saying the same thing over and over.  The best
lessons seemed to be the ones that were taught most quickly, since it
has a high density of new information.  We should strive to make more
lessons faster, and leave details to the reading.</p>
</section>
<section id="integrated-support-and-teaching">
<h2>Integrated support and teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#integrated-support-and-teaching" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Because the teachers also do support, for anything difficult, we can
easily tell learners: “Do what you can, come by our
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/#garage" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-ref">SciComp garage</span></a> to ask for help with anything
else.  This overall reduces the demands from teaching: a person
doesn’t have to know everything, but know enough to get started and to
know when they may need more help for more advanced tools.  This
really is good for both of us.</p>
</section>
<section id="linux-shell-and-other-prerequisites">
<h2>Linux shell and other prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#linux-shell-and-other-prerequisites" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>As usual, we expected our learners to read our <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/">shell crash course</a> in advance.  We also had
a new tutorial on <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/triton/tut/cluster-shell/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">using the cluster from the shell</span></a>.  This helped some, but it was still a
problem.</p>
<p>Reflection: this will always be a problem in any course that has a
wide enough audience.  We should accept and provide positive support
for those not ready, and not try to exclude them.  It’s OK to see a
course and then strive to get the prerequisites later.</p>
</section>
<section id="should-the-course-be-divided-into-two">
<h2>Should the course be divided into two?<a class="headerlink" href="#should-the-course-be-divided-into-two" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Internally, we had this thought of dividing the course in two: a basic
part at the start of the summer, and an advanced part at the end of
the summer -
since brand new researchers may have trouble understanding
everything.  On the other hand, the fact we have videos means that
people can come back and review the material when they are ready.  So
in some sense, learners can divide the course however they would like
by stopping when they think it’s no longer necessary and coming back.
This could be mentioned more explicitly in our introductions.</p>
</section>
<section id="attendance">
<h2>Attendance<a class="headerlink" href="#attendance" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Attendance goes down day-by-day.  This is definitely OK - it doesn’t
hurt anyone.  It’s expected that day 1 was suitable for the most
people (even those not doing HPC work), and then the course topics got
continually more specific as we went further and further.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this is even be expected and encouraged - better
to have someone attend day 1, than not.</p>
</section>
<section id="exercise-level">
<h2>Exercise level<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-level" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Our exercises are quite basic overall, but we got few complains about
this.  Basic exercises are better than something too advanced or
realistic, that requires many things to come together.</p>
<p>This year, we tried to have a complete solution for every exercise
(script and/or commands), even if it’s directly said above in the
lesson.  This seemed to be good, since for people very short of time,
they still have some chance to copy and paste and do the exercises.
For those passively following, they can at least see what would have
been done.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-feedback-from-the-notes">
<h2>Other feedback from the notes<a class="headerlink" href="#other-feedback-from-the-notes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Day 3 / end of course feedback positive feedback (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">o</span></code> is the way a
person votes for/agrees with that option:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>it’s great that the material is so easily accessible also after the
course to go through things in my own pace again oo</p></li>
<li><p>Really good format with the streaming and the shared document for
questions. ooooo</p></li>
<li><p>The cat kept me focused in the lecture</p></li>
<li><p>Live interaction with the instructes were very helpful and exercises were nice</p></li>
<li><p>I really appreaciate the instructors took the time to explain the
jargons, instead of just letting them fly around. o</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the instructors were really nice contributed to the
good course experience. Thanks for that! o</p></li>
<li><p>(day 1) After studying remotely for 1,5 year and having lots of
online classes, I highly appreciate the amazing audio quality
here. Many thanks for that!</p></li>
<li><p>(day 1) The framework is better than any other workshop I’ve ever
attended - in terms of interaction and audio quality. HackMD is
great.</p></li>
<li><p>(day 1) The (twitch) vertical screen thing is genius and should be
used in way more (online) lectures o</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most common negative feedback: not enough time! In fact, that’s
almost only thing to improve. Except we can’t, so I think we win
pretty well. And videos/material allows follow-up.</p>
