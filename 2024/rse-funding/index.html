<h1>Research Software Engineer project funding: what’s been working<a class="headerlink" href="#research-software-engineer-project-funding-what-s-been-working" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>The “Research Software Engineer” service provides technical
collaborators for researchers to complement their scientific
knowledge.  <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Read about Aalto RSE here</span></a>.
The idea of this service was that it would be available to everyone,
but some projects who made extensive use would fund it themselves.</p>
<p>If you are a group leader reading this, Aalto RSE can help you release
research code, debug it, make it reusable, rescue old code from former
members and make it usable again, make it run on our cluster or CSC’s
clusters, manage data, prepare data for easy use, and so on.  If it’s
not long (less than a month), our work is free, if it’s more than a
month, the below applies.</p>
<section id="early-project-funding">
<h2>Early project funding<a class="headerlink" href="#early-project-funding" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>When we started, we hoped for around 50% project funding.  The idea
was that a lot of the funding for the service would come from the
research projects themselves.  This hasn’t really worked out so well,
because a) we accomplish the vast majority of our projects quickly, in
less than a few weeks, and b) finance would understandably not like to
deal with small transactions for small amounts of time.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that we basically have received only a small amount of the
project funding we would have wanted.  On the other hand, this also
means we have supported a far wider variety of projects than we would
have otherwise.  It also means we are better accomplishing our other
goal: tactical support right where and when it’s needed most, with the
least amount of administrative overhead.  This actually better matches
our mission of helping the researchers who need us most.</p>
</section>
<section id="future-funding-prospects">
<h2>Future funding prospects<a class="headerlink" href="#future-funding-prospects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>For any <strong>long projects</strong> (more than a month or so), we still follow
do our original plan: we can receive funding from grants (or basic
funding) to do long-term projects.  This is usually 40-80% of a RSE’s
time, spread out over more than a month (and it can also be bursty:
lots of work at some times, waiting for the next task at other times).
We have done this for projects, and we know we can do it in the
future.</p>
<p>But there’s another thing that has worked well: <strong>retainer</strong>-type
funding instead of project-based funding.  You have extra funding that
needs to be used?  You know your group needs support but you can’t
name a single specific project to use all the time?  Hire RSEs on
long-term retainers and we’re there for you as needed.  <strong>You will
always get priority for all the quick questions you have</strong> (in
<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/help/garage/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Scicomp garage</span></a> or otherwise), and you get the highest
priority for your medium projects, we can attend your other group
meetings, and so on.  As your team wants, we’ll make high-impact
improvements here and there.  This could be (for example) anywhere
from 10-40% time over a long period.</p>
<p>We <em>have</em> worked out how to do both one-off projects and retainers
with Finance.  As for as external funders are concerned, our staff
count as researchers, so we can use any funding you might have.</p>
<p><strong>If you think you have a project or want us on retainer, let us
know:</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Research Software Engineers</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/how-we-work/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span>Starting a project with us</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-are-our-projects-so-short">
<h2>Why are our projects so short?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-our-projects-so-short" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is a valid questions.  Compared to many RSE groups, we seem to be
focusing on many small questions for a broad audience that knows a lot
about the problems they need to solve.  Thus, we can come in to
something already set up well, provide help, and mostly back off and
be available for maintenance long-term.  The units that fund us
(schools, departments) have been happy with this, so we’ve kept it up.
On the other hand, we are pretty fast.  There have been projects where
a summer worker was going to be hired, that we could end up doing
(learning the framework + all the main tasks) in two weeks.  The way
we work together as a team also makes things quite fast.  Thus, a
project has to be quite deep in order to exceed a month of work.</p>
