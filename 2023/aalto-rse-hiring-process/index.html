<h1>The Aalto RSE hiring process<a class="headerlink" href="#the-aalto-rse-hiring-process" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This post describes the hiring process of Aalto RSE.  The goal is to
make hiring more equitable by providing the background information so
that everyone can apply successfully.  For those not applying to us,
it might still provide some valuable insight about how to market your
skills as a PhD making a sideways career move.  What’s said here may
not apply to every organization, but it might give you some things to
think about.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This page is a rough average description of the past, not
a promise to always do this in the future.</p>
<section id="background">
<h2>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Aalto RSE</span></a> has usually hired people who have postdoc
experience and will transition to a more applied
software/data/computing oriented role (as opposed to being focused on
writing papers).  For many people, we are the first experience of job
applications post-degree and thus people have to learn how to present
their skills in a new, non-academic context.</p>
<p>One should start by reading about us - we have lots of information
publicly available about what we do and how we think.  This should be
understood in order to do the next steps well.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-cover-letter">
<h2>The cover letter<a class="headerlink" href="#the-cover-letter" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The cover letter is the most important thing we read, and the first
and most important filter.  It’s read before the CV.</p>
<p>At the level we are at, almost everyone’s CV and achievements are
effectively equivalent.  Does it matter who got the most fancy papers?
Who has the most awards?  The classes people took?  When most of a
person’s knowledge has come from self-study, probably not.  The cover
letter is the chance to interpret your skills in the context of the
job you are applying for.</p>
<p>When reading the cover letter, the first question we ask is “does this
person know what they are applying to and know why they think they are
a good fit?”  (It’s always interesting to get letters which clearly
don’t understand the job, but on the other hand it’s an easy filter.)
The first paragraph should answer this question and that the rest of
the letter will go into detail about why.  Start with the most
important information, don’t make it hard for us.</p>
<p>Beyond that, talk about interests and skills as relevant to the
organization.  Discuss special projects, including non-academic ones
or random things that you are interested in (this is especially true
for us, since we are the transition from academia to practical work).
Our job advertisement gives you some specific ideas that you can talk
about.  Anything specifically important to the job should be pointed
out here and not just left in the CV.</p>
<p>If you don’t exactly fit the stated job requirements: here is the
chance to explain it.  The job requirement has to say roughly what we
need (to not waste people’s time when applying, and because our hiring
decisions must be justifiable based on the requirements), but there
are many cases where someone with a different experience can
accomplish our actual goal (as said in the job ad or found in your
background research).  A person that can say this, that they are
adaptable, and will have a very good chance.</p>
<p>We have adopted some system of anonymous recruiting.  We request that
cover letters are submitted without identifying information (name,
signature, etc) so that one person gives them numbers, and a broader
group tries to take a non-biased look at them.  After this initial
impression, we bring in the rest of the application.  Don’t make
assumptions about what the reader will know about your background,
just say it.</p>
<p>The letter should be as short as possible to get the information
across.  One page is usually about the shortest we get, and a bit less
than two pages is typical.  But if it’s engaging, we’ll read as much
as you write.  Remember, most important information first, don’t make
us hunt for things.</p>
<p>Update 2024: Do you want to use AI to write your cover letter?  Please
think again.  Since LLMs became a thing, cover letters have become
harder to read, longer, and more generic-sounding.  It’s better to
write in your own voice and be shorter than rely on what AI gives
you.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-rest-of-the-job-application">
<h2>The rest of the job application<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rest-of-the-job-application" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The CV serves as non-anonymous reference information, but they are
hard to read and all look pretty similar.  To be honest, we don’t
worry that much about the format and contents here: get us basic
factual information in the most efficient way.  For our particular
jobs, non-academic skills such as software/data tools are more
important than scientific articles, etc.   Remember, we are busy
and have plenty of applications, make it easy to read.</p>
<p>Open Science isn’t just good for research, it’s good for you, too.  If
you can point to public repositories of work you have done, this is
very useful.  Things like Gitlab/Github profiles with activity and
your own projects, links to data you have released, etc.  They don’t
have to be perfect - something is better than nothing.  The best case
would be a few projects which are well-done (and you know it and point
them out to us), and plenty more stuff that may be of lower quality to
show you can get simple stuff done simply.  Not everyone is fortunate
to have a field where they can practice open science throughout their
career, but even publishing a project or two before they apply for a
job with us is very useful.</p>
<p>Despite what the previous section said, we do try to dig through
applications that seem on-topic but don’t say everything we are looking
for, to give them the most fair shot we can.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-filtering-process">
<h2>The filtering process<a class="headerlink" href="#the-filtering-process" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We always need to heavily filter the list down.  Some relevant
filtering includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do they know what job they are applying for?  Can they connect their
skills to the job?</p></li>
<li><p>Have they touched on the main points in our job advertisement and
the linked “<a class="reference external" href="https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/become-a-rse/" title="(in Aalto Scientific Computing)"><span class="xref std std-doc">Become a RSE</span></a>” page?</p></li>
<li><p>Are they interested in teaching, mentoring, and real collaborative
projects?  Do they know what kind of teaching and mentoring we do?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there enough knowledge about the research process?</p></li>
<li><p>Any relevant skills about this call’s particular topic (if there is
any)?</p></li>
<li><p>How do their skills and experience match what our team is currently
missing, regardless of the open call?</p></li>
<li><p>How similar has their previous work been to “research engineering”
(helping the research process) instead of only focusing on academic
promotion?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The recruitment team makes several passes over and we discuss how to
filter down.  We try to get a good variety of candidates.</p>
</section>
<section id="interviews">
<h2>Interviews<a class="headerlink" href="#interviews" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, there is some initial recorded “video interviews”, which
provide some initial familiarity in both directions before the actual
interviews.  We know these are non-interactive and a recording isn’t a
conversation so this is harder than an interview, but we consider that
when watching them.  One shouldn’t worry too much about these, if we
do them.</p>
<p>Our actual interviews are not designed to be stressful.  We have some
prepared questions and go through them in a friendly manner.  You have
a chance to ask questions to use at the beginning and end (and any
other time too).  The questions are designed to hear about your
experiences and not trick or test you.</p>
<p>We don’t currently ask technical challenge questions.  The number of
things which you’d need to know is so broad, it’s more important that
you can learn things quickly.  Since we usually interview relatively
advanced people, we can instead look at existing projects they have
done and check references, without having to do a technical
challenge.  This may change depending on the type of candidates we are
interviewing, but just like the main interviews we are more interested
in how people think, rather than raw knowledge.</p>
<p>In the future, there might be more “meet the team” kind of events.</p>
<p>We want to respond to people as soon as possible, but there’s a simple
fact: we don’t want to tell anyone “no” until we are very sure we have
an acceptance (we don’t want to tell someone “no” and then hire them
later), and we have very many qualified candidates.  So there is often
an unfortunately long delay in hearing back.  We hope that everyone
knows within a month, though (and ideally ~2 weeks if all goes well).</p>
</section>
<section id="if-you-don-t-make-it">
<h2>If you don’t make it<a class="headerlink" href="#if-you-don-t-make-it" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We get a relatively large number of applications, with a lot of good
people.  So far (before 2023), we have been hiring at a relatively
high level - researchers with postdoc experience who have been some
sort of RSE-like experience with helping others with research (beyond
only focusing on making papers for themselves) and technology.
Don’t let this discourage you.  There are many qualified applications,
so if you don’t get selected, that doesn’t mean that you were
unqualified.  We look at everyone, regardless of their level, for
every position.  The fit to our particular job is more important that
anything else, so keep trying until you get the right fit - it’s just
a numbers game.</p>
