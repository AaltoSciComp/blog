Triton v3 is now default
========================

Triton has a major update.  You can read our previous info about this at
:doc:`/2023/preparing-for-new-triton`, and our "what has changed" in
`Triton issue #1593 <https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/-/issues/1593>`__.

You might get :doc:`SSH host key warnings</2024/ssh-host-key-warnings>`.


What is Triton v3
-----------------

It has the same name, and importantly the same user accounts and data,
but all the software and operating system is changed.  In particular:

* All software modules are different
* Any software which has been complied will need to be re-compiled.


Why, and why now?
-----------------

Triton's previous operating system was released in 2014.  Security
support runs out at the end of 2024 May, and it *has* to be updated.
Stability is good for research, so we try to reduce the number of
changes (compare)

We realize that a change is very disruptive and painful, especially
since the expectation is that Triton never changes.  But an old
operating system makes problem for users too, and they have gotten
more and more over the years.


What to do
----------

Most of the transition for different types of software is described in
`Triton issue #1593
<https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/AaltoScienceIT/triton/-/issues/1593>`__.
