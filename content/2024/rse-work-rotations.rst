RSE work rotations
==================

Let's say you want to start a Research (Software) Engineer team in
your own unit.  How do you set your new hires off on the right
path?  A proposal is outlined below.

This is a companion post to :doc:`/2024/rse-collaboration`.



Getting started
---------------

You need to find the right person to hire for the role.  Most likely,
this means someone with the skills you need but the mindset to
transition from their own work to making other work possible.  You can
find hiring resources on :external:doc:`the Aalto RSE page
<rse/index>` and some brief thoughts in the companion post
:doc:`/2024/rse-collaboration`.



An apprenticeship proposal
--------------------------

This proposal is much easier for someone inside of Aalto University
than outside, but possibly could be negotiated for others.

- Your new hire works as part of the existing School of Science RSE
  team initially, perhaps ~1 year.  The hire is paid,
  organizationally supervised in, and sits in your own unit.
- They focus on projects from your own unit, but as part of our daily
  flow.  This could mean asking your audience to join our
  :external:doc:`help/garage` for help and requesting that new big
  projects come via our project management systems.
- Your new hire will learn all about how we work.
- Your new hire will experience a tremendous diversity of projects and
  work with experts on them.
- After the initial ~1 year period, we sit down and decide what is
  next.  Does your new hire stay working as part of our team (with a
  greater focus on your own unit's projects)?  Or do they split off
  and start doing their own thing in your unit?  Or some combination?

This gives you the most important part of our onboarding and training.
There is no better way to develop the right mindset.  If we split
later, your staff will know who to ask for harder problems that come
up later.
