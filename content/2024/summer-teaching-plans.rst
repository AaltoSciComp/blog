2024 summer teaching plans
==========================

It may seem a long time ago,  but summer is approaching.  That means
it's time to start announcing our summer teaching activities.  This is
the 2024 implementation of our :doc:`yearly kickstart and onboarding
strategy </2023/kickstart>`

"Kickstart" means it's a first look and practical steps to get started
quickly, but not the most advanced course.



Summer plan
-----------

The course page: :external:doc:`training/scip/kickstart-2024`

Each June, we have a training program designed around the schedule of
new summer research interns.

* (Monday reserved for local department activities)
* **Day 1: Tue, 4 Mar**: A very broad introduction to scientific
  computing and how to organizing your research
* **Day 2: Tue, 5 Mar**: How to use the computing cluster: basics
* **Day 3: Tue, 6 Mar**: Continuation of day 2, but more advanced and
  getting to parallelism and running many things at once
* (Friday can be used by specialized tutorials and follow-ups with
  specific tools)

Each day is approximately 12:00-16:00, online (livestream), with
videos available by the same evening.  It's completely OK to come the
only days you can, for example only the first day for those who aren't
using the computer cluster, or skipping the last day and coming back
to it once you need those tools.



What you should do
------------------

* If you are a new researcher: definitely register and reserve the
  dates.  Attend until it starts to feel unnecessary for you.
* Department HR and coordinators: add this to the information you give
  to new researchers.  If you department is computationally oriented,
  try to integrate this into your schedule.
* If you are not at Aalto but think this is relevant to you or the
  people you support, send them to our course and/or contribute.

  * We've designed this course so that it's also suitable as an
    introduction at other locations - most universities in Finland
    send their students here (online).  Wherever you are, you could
    send your students as well.  We also welcome co-teachers.

  * We have :external:doc:`info on what your cluster needs to have to
    follow along <triton/tut/required-cluster-setup>`, but we are open
    to ideas to make it more reusable.

  * Our "lecture/demo, then exercise" format is suitable for you to
    help your local audience during the exercises to fill in what's
    different for you.



Other teaching
--------------

The "Kickstart" course is one of our capstones.  There is also:

* `CodeRefinery March 12-14 and 19-21
  <https://coderefinery.github.io/2024-03-12-workshop/>`__, which you
  could say is more basic handling code for scientists (not a
  prerequisite).
* The more advanced :external:doc:`workflows course
  <training/scip/workflows-2024>` which is more advanced, but
  different: it's designed to show full examples of how the cluster is
  actually used, not be a tutorial of the individual pieces.
