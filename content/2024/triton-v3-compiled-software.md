# Triton v3: compiled software and toolchains

*This post will be updated with additional info, as people ask questions to us.*

This blog post describes how to migrate to Triton V3, if you use
compiled software.  Read more about the migration at {doc}`/2024/triton-v3`.  Our main documentation at scicomp.aalto.fi is in the progress of being updated (and may not be fully updated yet).


All complied software must be re-compiled.  You can find compilers and libraries if you search for modules.  Everything is re-installed, so some lesser-used things might still be missing (ask us in that case).

The blog post is created to have a place to update FAQs about the transition, that might be hard to find from scicomp.aalto.fi.  Check back here if you have problems.
