Kickstart 2023 wrap-up and thoughts for the future
==================================================

Our :external:doc:`kickstart course
<training/scip/kickstart-2023>` came and
went with very few problems.  This post summarizes our general
thoughts on the course and its format.

If you want to join the course next year (as an attendee, or as an
organization who will send your learners to us (and maybe co-teach)
`follow us on Mastodon <https://fosstodon.org/@SciCompAalto>`__.  This
is the third year we've done the livestream format, and it's not
likely to stop anytime soon.

*This was originally written in June 2023 but publication was
forgotten until 2024.*


History of the course
---------------------
The course has run since around 2015 or so.  Until mid 2020, it was always
in-person only.  Until (and including) 2022, it ran twice a year,
January and June, but now it runs only in June (increased availability
of videos + the material compensates).  It runs in June so that it
aligns with new summer research interns starting.  Until around 2020,
it was mostly about using the :external:doc:`HPC cluster at Aalto
University <triton/index>`, but since then there has been more
emphasis on day 1 covering generic skills needed for scientific
computing and the big picture of things.



General feedback
----------------

Our general feedback remains quite positive.  Our streaming +
coteaching + collaborative notes format is still well received, and
there seems to be little reason to go back for courses of smaller
scale.  Instead of just lectures, written material (tutorials in info
on scicomp.aalto.fi) + livestream + videos is a good combination.



Not enough time
---------------

There is never enough time - not much else to say.  Each year there is
a different trade-off between how much we cover and how brief we are.
(There are always people who say we should go more in-depth, and some
who say we go too much in-depth.  Such is life.)



Reduce repetition
-----------------

Repetition is good, but not when it's a sign that we can't stop
talking and keep saying the same thing over and over.  The best
lessons seemed to be the ones that were taught most quickly, since it
has a high density of new information.  We should strive to make more
lessons faster, and leave details to the reading.



Integrated support and teaching
-------------------------------

Because the teachers also do support, for anything difficult, we can
easily tell learners: "Do what you can, come by our
:external:ref:`SciComp garage <garage>` to ask for help with anything
else.  This overall reduces the demands from teaching: a person
doesn't have to know everything, but know enough to get started and to
know when they may need more help for more advanced tools.  This
really is good for both of us.


Linux shell and other prerequisites
-----------------------------------

As usual, we expected our learners to read our `shell crash course
<https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/>`__ in advance.  We also had
a new tutorial on :external:doc:`using the cluster from the shell
<triton/tut/cluster-shell>`.  This helped some, but it was still a
problem.

Reflection: this will always be a problem in any course that has a
wide enough audience.  We should accept and provide positive support
for those not ready, and not try to exclude them.  It's OK to see a
course and then strive to get the prerequisites later.



Should the course be divided into two?
--------------------------------------

Internally, we had this thought of dividing the course in two: a basic
part at the start of the summer, and an advanced part at the end of
the summer -
since brand new researchers may have trouble understanding
everything.  On the other hand, the fact we have videos means that
people can come back and review the material when they are ready.  So
in some sense, learners can divide the course however they would like
by stopping when they think it's no longer necessary and coming back.
This could be mentioned more explicitly in our introductions.



Attendance
----------

Attendance goes down day-by-day.  This is definitely OK - it doesn't
hurt anyone.  It's expected that day 1 was suitable for the most
people (even those not doing HPC work), and then the course topics got
continually more specific as we went further and further.

As mentioned above, this is even be expected and encouraged - better
to have someone attend day 1, than not.



Exercise level
--------------

Our exercises are quite basic overall, but we got few complains about
this.  Basic exercises are better than something too advanced or
realistic, that requires many things to come together.

This year, we tried to have a complete solution for every exercise
(script and/or commands), even if it's directly said above in the
lesson.  This seemed to be good, since for people very short of time,
they still have some chance to copy and paste and do the exercises.
For those passively following, they can at least see what would have
been done.



Other feedback from the notes
-----------------------------

Day 3 / end of course feedback positive feedback (``o`` is the way a
person votes for/agrees with that option:

- it’s great that the material is so easily accessible also after the
  course to go through things in my own pace again oo
- Really good format with the streaming and the shared document for
  questions. ooooo
- The cat kept me focused in the lecture
- Live interaction with the instructes were very helpful and exercises were nice
- I really appreaciate the instructors took the time to explain the
  jargons, instead of just letting them fly around. o
- The fact that the instructors were really nice contributed to the
  good course experience. Thanks for that! o
- (day 1) After studying remotely for 1,5 year and having lots of
  online classes, I highly appreciate the amazing audio quality
  here. Many thanks for that!
- (day 1) The framework is better than any other workshop I’ve ever
  attended - in terms of interaction and audio quality. HackMD is
  great.
- (day 1) The (twitch) vertical screen thing is genius and should be
  used in way more (online) lectures o

Most common negative feedback: not enough time! In fact, that's
almost only thing to improve. Except we can't, so I think we win
pretty well. And videos/material allows follow-up.
