How we do large course registration
===================================

It's recently been asked how we do registration for large courses -
this explains it.  This is in particular about our large MOOC-like
livestreamed courses.

We have a registration form open to the whole world, and anyone is
welcome to sign up.  Registering only promises to give you emails
about the course - the extra things listed below are optional.  We
also try to put all necessary information onto the course website
(updated each day with the end-of-day / prepare for the next day
info), so that someone can follow along without registering.  This is
an explicit goal: the course can be followed for free, without even
giving personal information to register.

And that's basically it.  Follow the course, or don't.  Sign up to get
emails with information or check the website yourself.  The basic
concept scales to however many people with no extra effort on our
part.



Optional extras
---------------

The above isn't necessarily a very compelling course, since there is
limited interaction.  So, we offer some optional extras:

* **Collaborative notes**: this is our core way of interaction.  Our
  anti-troll strategy is to not give the notes document publicly, but
  only for (a) anyone registering or (b) anyone registering from a
  partner.

  We've usually done (a) in many courses.  We've never had a problem
  with collaborative notes trolls so far.

* **Zoom exercise room**: based on registration email, we offer to
  people at Aalto and other partners the opportunity for more
  interaction in Zoom.  This is something for live support during the
  exercise times of the course.

  In practice, there usually aren't that many people that are in Zoom,
  and handling all the questions we might get is pretty easy.

  Usually, this would be offered for anyone from a country of one of
  the organizing partners (the usual suspects are Finland, Sweden,
  Norway).

* **In-person exercise session**: Offered to those from Aalto (or
  really, from all Finnish universities).  There have been anywhere
  from ~3 people to a busy room of ~15 (for a course with hundreds of
  registrations).  We have always made this a "drop-in" thing with no
  special sign-up needed, and supermarket snacks provided (so that we
  can buy plenty cheaply, save them, and not have to worry about
  no-shows).

  Others in other locations could easily do this, too.



What else could be done
-----------------------

What we *don't* do in our courses is teams in the way that
CodeRefinery tries (which involves custom-creating small groups of
people with a team leader).  This worked very, very well when it
worked, but was beyond the amount of coordination effort we have.

We encourage learners to form their own teams and work together (like
watching and doing exercises together in a meeting room).  We know
some people do this, but don't really have ways to know just how many
do so (since we can't rely on our polls).



Sharing data
------------

To make some of these possible, we need to share registration data
with others so that they can announce things like local in-person
rooms / Zoom sessions.  What we have said lately is during the
registration that we may share registrations with partners for these
type of local things, but doesn't scale to many partners (for data
protection reasons).  In practice, this has only been CodeRefinery
partners.

We also list all local activities on the website, so that the audience
could use the registration forms of these other partners directly.  We
can also mention these partners in our general emails.  This is
slightly more scaleable, since we don't have to worry about sharing
personal data.
