Easy audio transcription with speech2text
=========================================

At ASC, we are always looking for ways to improve the accessibility of
computing tools.  We recently identified a need for speech
transcription (for example, interviews).  It's easy to :doc:`install
software such as Whisper <whisper-deployed-llms-coming>` for
transcription, but is it easy enough for everyone to use?  For
example, we saw a strong need for transcription from the Aalto School
of Business, from people who haven't used a HPC cluster before.

-----------

what is speech2text

how it's typically used

how others can use it on their own clusters and stuff

If you want to use this yourself, what to do.



Under the hood
--------------

brief technical explanation so that other technical people can
understand just what we did.



Lessons learned
---------------

With software designed for usability / clear instructions, even
novices could use the HPC cluster and like it.

What was hard?  Data transfer?

Will we do more of this in the future?
