The Aalto RSE hiring process
============================

This post describes the hiring process of Aalto RSE.  The goal is to
make hiring more equitable by providing the background information so
that everyone can apply successfully.  For those not applying to us,
it might still provide some valuable insight about how to market your
skills as a PhD making a sideways career move.  What's said here may
not apply to every organization, but it might give you some things to
think about.

Disclaimer: This page is a rough average description of the past, not
a promise to always do this in the future.


Background
----------

:external:doc:`Aalto RSE <rse/index>` has usually hired people who have postdoc
experience and will transition to a more applied
software/data/computing oriented role (as opposed to being focused on
writing papers).  For many people, we are the first experience of job
applications post-degree and thus people have to learn how to present
their skills in a new, non-academic context.

One should start by reading about us - we have lots of information
publicly available about what we do and how we think.  This should be
understood in order to do the next steps well.


The cover letter
----------------

The cover letter is the most important thing we read, and the first
and most important filter.  It's read before the CV.

At the level we are at, almost everyone's CV and achievements are
effectively equivalent.  Does it matter who got the most fancy papers?
Who has the most awards?  The classes people took?  When most of a
person's knowledge has come from self-study, probably not.  The cover
letter is the chance to interpret your skills in the context of the
job you are applying for.

When reading the cover letter, the first question we ask is "does this
person know what they are applying to and know why they think they are
a good fit?"  (It's always interesting to get letters which clearly
don't understand the job, but on the other hand it's an easy filter.)
The first paragraph should answer this question and that the rest of
the letter will go into detail about why.  Start with the most
important information, don't make it hard for us.

Beyond that, talk about interests and skills as relevant to the
organization.  Discuss special projects, including non-academic ones
or random things that you are interested in (this is especially true
for us, since we are the transition from academia to practical work).
Our job advertisement gives you some specific ideas that you can talk
about.  Anything specifically important to the job should be pointed
out here and not just left in the CV.

If you don't exactly fit the stated job requirements: here is the
chance to explain it.  The job requirement has to say roughly what we
need (to not waste people's time when applying, and because our hiring
decisions must be justifiable based on the requirements), but there
are many cases where someone with a different experience can
accomplish our actual goal (as said in the job ad or found in your
background research).  A person that can say this, that they are
adaptable, and will have a very good chance.

We have adopted some system of anonymous recruiting.  We request that
cover letters are submitted without identifying information (name,
signature, etc) so that one person gives them numbers, and a broader
group tries to take a non-biased look at them.  After this initial
impression, we bring in the rest of the application.  Don't make
assumptions about what the reader will know about your background,
just say it.

The letter should be as short as possible to get the information
across.  One page is usually about the shortest we get, and a bit less
than two pages is typical.  But if it's engaging, we'll read as much
as you write.  Remember, most important information first, don't make
us hunt for things.

Update 2024: Do you want to use AI to write your cover letter?  Please
think again.  Since LLMs became a thing, cover letters have become
harder to read, longer, and more generic-sounding.  It's better to
write in your own voice and be shorter than rely on what AI gives
you.


The rest of the job application
-------------------------------

The CV serves as non-anonymous reference information, but they are
hard to read and all look pretty similar.  To be honest, we don't
worry that much about the format and contents here: get us basic
factual information in the most efficient way.  For our particular
jobs, non-academic skills such as software/data tools are more
important than scientific articles, etc.   Remember, we are busy
and have plenty of applications, make it easy to read.

Open Science isn't just good for research, it's good for you, too.  If
you can point to public repositories of work you have done, this is
very useful.  Things like Gitlab/Github profiles with activity and
your own projects, links to data you have released, etc.  They don't
have to be perfect - something is better than nothing.  The best case
would be a few projects which are well-done (and you know it and point
them out to us), and plenty more stuff that may be of lower quality to
show you can get simple stuff done simply.  Not everyone is fortunate
to have a field where they can practice open science throughout their
career, but even publishing a project or two before they apply for a
job with us is very useful.

Despite what the previous section said, we do try to dig through
applications that seem on-topic but don't say everything we are looking
for, to give them the most fair shot we can.


The filtering process
---------------------

We always need to heavily filter the list down.  Some relevant
filtering includes:

* Do they know what job they are applying for?  Can they connect their
  skills to the job?

* Have they touched on the main points in our job advertisement and
  the linked ":external:doc:`Become a RSE <rse/become-a-rse>`" page?

* Are they interested in teaching, mentoring, and real collaborative
  projects?  Do they know what kind of teaching and mentoring we do?

* Is there enough knowledge about the research process?

* Any relevant skills about this call's particular topic (if there is
  any)?

* How do their skills and experience match what our team is currently
  missing, regardless of the open call?

* How similar has their previous work been to "research engineering"
  (helping the research process) instead of only focusing on academic
  promotion?

The recruitment team makes several passes over and we discuss how to
filter down.  We try to get a good variety of candidates.


Interviews
----------

Sometimes, there is some initial recorded "video interviews", which
provide some initial familiarity in both directions before the actual
interviews.  We know these are non-interactive and a recording isn't a
conversation so this is harder than an interview, but we consider that
when watching them.  One shouldn't worry too much about these, if we
do them.

Our actual interviews are not designed to be stressful.  We have some
prepared questions and go through them in a friendly manner.  You have
a chance to ask questions to use at the beginning and end (and any
other time too).  The questions are designed to hear about your
experiences and not trick or test you.

We don't currently ask technical challenge questions.  The number of
things which you'd need to know is so broad, it's more important that
you can learn things quickly.  Since we usually interview relatively
advanced people, we can instead look at existing projects they have
done and check references, without having to do a technical
challenge.  This may change depending on the type of candidates we are
interviewing, but just like the main interviews we are more interested
in how people think, rather than raw knowledge.

In the future, there might be more "meet the team" kind of events.

We want to respond to people as soon as possible, but there's a simple
fact: we don't want to tell anyone "no" until we are very sure we have
an acceptance (we don't want to tell someone "no" and then hire them
later), and we have very many qualified candidates.  So there is often
an unfortunately long delay in hearing back.  We hope that everyone
knows within a month, though (and ideally ~2 weeks if all goes well).


If you don't make it
--------------------

We get a relatively large number of applications, with a lot of good
people.  So far (before 2023), we have been hiring at a relatively
high level - researchers with postdoc experience who have been some
sort of RSE-like experience with helping others with research (beyond
only focusing on making papers for themselves) and technology.
Don't let this discourage you.  There are many qualified applications,
so if you don't get selected, that doesn't mean that you were
unqualified.  We look at everyone, regardless of their level, for
every position.  The fit to our particular job is more important that
anything else, so keep trying until you get the right fit - it's just
a numbers game.

   Aalto Scientific Computing is looking for a

   **Research Software Engineer/Supporter**

   To a permanent, full-time position.

   Are you more of a programmer than your researcher colleagues? Are you
   more of a researcher than commercial developers? Do you fit in both, but
   have a home in neither? Be a Research Software Engineer with us and find
   your home. If you are looking for a career path which combines the
   interesting parts of both fields, this is a good choice.

   `Aalto Scientific Computing <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/about/>`__ is an
   elite "special forces" unit of Research IT, providing high-performance
   computing hardware, management, research support, teaching, and
   training. Our team consists of a core of PhD staff working with top
   researchers throughout the university. Our services are used by every
   school at Aalto University and known throughout Finland and the Nordics.
   All our work is open-source by default and we take an active part in
   worldwide projects.

   **In this position, you will:**

   -  Provide software development and consulting as a service, depending
      on demand from research groups.

   -  Provide one-on-one research support from a software, programming,
      Linux, data, and infrastructure perspective: short-term projects
      helping researchers with specific tasks, so that the researchers
      gain competence to work independently.

   -  As needed and depending on interest, teaching and other research
      infrastructure support.

   -  Continually learn new skills as part of our team.

   **Primary qualifications**: There are two main tracks, and candidates of
   diverse backgrounds are encouraged to apply – every candidate will be
   evaluated according to their own unique experiences.

   -  PhD degree with research experience in some computational field and
      much knowledge of practical computing strategies for research, or

   -  Software developer or computational scientist with a strong
      software/open source/Linux background, scientific computing
      experience, and some experience in research. Masters degree or
      similar experience.

   **This particular call emphasizes the ability to work in machine
   learning and AI environments**. The ideal candidate will be working
   closely with machine learning researchers, and thus a background in
   machine learning is highly desirable.

   **Important skills:**

   -  Ability to tackle any problem with a researcher's mindset and a
      developer's passion for technology.

   -  Experience or knowledge of the principles of open source software,
      open science, and software development tools such as version
      control.

   -  Please see https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/become-a-rse/ for more
      information on what kind of skills we value - or more precisely
      what you are likely to learn.

   -  You will join the dynamic Aalto Scientific Computing team, where you
      will learn from some of the best research IT specialists in
      Finland.

   -  Co-working within top-quality research groups, getting experience in
      a wide variety of fields and developing an extensive network of
      scientific contacts. This includes contacts to the Aalto startup
      scene and community.

   -  A way to be close to the research process while focusing on
      interesting computational problems and not the publication
      process.

   -  Our program will offer you a chance to improve your software skills –
      you are expected to engage in plenty of professional development.

   -  Open Source is our expectation. All (or most) of your code may be
      open source and may be added to your public CV, depending on the
      needs of researchers.

   Salary will be according to experience, for a recently graduated PhD
   similar to a postdoc salary. Work hours are flexible, but are expected
   to sync with the audience being served. Primary workplace is Otaniemi,
   Espoo (Helsinki region), Finland. Aalto University has a hybrid work
   policy which allows 60% remote work possibility, and our team takes good
   advantage of this flexibility.

   **To apply successfully**:

   -  Please include a separate cover letter (~1-2 pages). Please try to
      write your cover letter avoiding information like name, gender,
      nationality or other demographic information that is not directly
      related to why you would be the right person for this position
      (this includes, for example, a signature on the letter) unless you
      think it benefits you. This will assist in anonymous recruitment
      possibilities. The letter should include for example:

      -  highlight one (or a few) collaborative projects you have taken
         part in and your role within it, and

      -  what you bring and what you intend to learn.

   -  A normal professional or academic CV including

      -  a list of your technical and programming tools and level of
         proficiency (e.g. basic/proficient/expert). This is the time to
         show the breadth of your experience.

      -  Github link or other public sample code. If not available,
         whatever is possible to demonstrate past programming
         experience. Please highlight one or two of your outstanding
         research software projects.
